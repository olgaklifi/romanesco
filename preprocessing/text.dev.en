“—instant of passion?” he said, and would have gone on, but at that word, as at a pang of physical pain, her lips stiffened again, and again the muscles of her right cheek worked.
And the prince went out of the room.
“Nonsense, Anna Arkadyevna,” said Korsunsky, drawing her bare arm under the sleeve of his dress coat, “I’ve such an idea for a _cotillion!
Kitty felt that Anna was perfectly simple and was concealing nothing, but that she had another higher world of interests inaccessible to her, complex and poetic.
Isn’t it the life all of you, all young men, always lead?” she said, knitting her brows; and taking up the crochet work that was lying on the table, she began drawing the hook out of it, without looking at Vronsky.
Your mother was asleep in the corner.
“Is Seryozha quite well?” he said, and not waiting for an answer, he added: “I shan’t be dining at home today, and I have got to go out directly.” “I had thought of going to Moscow,” she said.
Vronsky stepped into the carriage.
Chairs were set with the aid of footmen, moving almost imperceptibly about the room; the party settled itself, divided into two groups: one round the samovar near the hostess, the other at the opposite end of the drawing-room, round the handsome wife of an ambassador, in black velvet, with sharply defined black eyebrows.
The stairs up to her room came out on the landing of the great warm main staircase.
“Stiva!
Try leeches.
The cattle, bald in patches where the new hair had not grown yet, lowed in the pastures; the bowlegged lambs frisked round their bleating mothers.
From his conversation with the old man, Levin thought he was not averse to new methods either.
Why are the children here?
“One thing might be said, if you will allow me to make the remark....” observed Golenishtchev.
Vronsky understood now that this was Madame Karenina.
And she was continually picturing them to herself, at one moment each separately, and then both together.
The old prince, like all fathers indeed, was exceedingly punctilious on the score of the honor and reputation of his daughters.
As she raked together what was left of the hay, the young wife shook off the bits of hay that had fallen on her neck, and straightening the red kerchief that had dropped forward over her white brow, not browned like her face by the sun, she crept under the cart to tie up the load.
“Oh!
“I’ve tried it.
Directly the servant had set the tea and left the room, Alexey Alexandrovitch got up and went to the writing-table.
And then all at once love turns up, and you’re done for, done for,” Stepan Arkadyevitch said with weary despair.
She dressed quickly, went downstairs, and with resolute steps walked into the drawing-room, where she found, as usual, waiting for her, the coffee, Seryozha, and his governess.
The other confession set her weeping bitterly.
Why she said this, which she had not thought of a second before, she could not have explained.
“Here, if you please,” he said, moving on one side with his nimble gait and pointing to his picture, “it’s the exhortation to Pilate.
“I am dying; I beg, I implore you to come.
Some supernatural force drew Kitty’s eyes to Anna’s face.
“Well, I have had some today already,” said the old man, obviously accepting the invitation with pleasure.
The high grass softly turned about the wheels and the horse’s legs, leaving its seeds clinging to the wet axles and spokes of the wheels.
For the first moment only, Vronsky was startled after the impression of a quite different world that he had brought with him from Moscow.
“However, we can go into that later.” “Yes, later.
Moreover, Levin knew that at Sviazhsky’s he should meet the landowners of the neighborhood, and it was particularly interesting for him just now to hear and take part in those rural conversations concerning crops, laborers’ wages, and so on, which, he was aware, are conventionally regarded as something very low, but which seemed to him just now to constitute the one subject of importance.
She was listening to the stirring of the new life within her.
He felt himself a king, not because he believed that he had made an impression on Anna—he did not yet believe that,—but because the impression she had made on him gave him happiness and pride.
As Serpuhovskoy came down the steps he saw Vronsky.
“Well, what am I going to do?
To talk of outside things seemed to him shocking, impossible, to talk of death and depressing subjects—also impossible.
There are people, on the other hand, who desire above all to find in that lucky rival the qualities by which he has outstripped them, and seek with a throbbing ache at heart only what is good.
It was all common, poor, and stale, and positively badly painted—weak and unequal.
Permanent hands, day-laborers, rammers—you can’t get out of those forms.” “But Europe is dissatisfied with these forms.” “Dissatisfied, and seeking new ones.
“A priceless man!” said the Countess Lidia Ivanovna.
There are people who, on meeting a successful rival, no matter in what, are at once disposed to turn their backs on everything good in him, and to see only what is bad.
It was revealed to her that besides the instinctive life to which Kitty had given herself up hitherto there was a spiritual life.
“In what way?” “Some peaches were lying on the table in the corner room.
He knows all about it, he sees it all; what does he care if he can talk so calmly?
His brother Sergey Ivanovitch, Stepan Arkadyevitch, and the princess guided him in doing what he had to do.
He did not understand how his pity for her exasperated her.
The government clerk lodges a complaint, and I became a mediator, and such a mediator!...
“Define what it is you find....” “Pardon, let me say all I have to say.
“I gave that life up long ago,” said he, wondering at the change in her face, and trying to divine its meaning.
“Ah!” he began joyously.
Seryozha had been caught by the rain in the big garden, and he and his nurse had taken shelter in an arbor.
“Shall you be long in Moscow?
“Anyone who likes amalgamating is welcome to it, but it sickens me.” “You’re a regular reactionist, I see.” “Really, I have never considered what I am.
“I’m no judge, of course.
Nothing.
“Sure to be someone with papers for me,” put in Stepan Arkadyevitch.
He would clearly have died sooner than own it was hard work for him.
He gets something from the Academy,” she went on briskly, trying to drown the distress that the queer change in Anna Pavlovna’s manner to her had aroused in her.
You must settle with him, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,” said the bailiff.
“Not going at all?” “No; don’t unpack till tomorrow, and let the carriage wait.
Through the frosty vapor could be seen workmen in short sheepskins and soft felt boots crossing the rails of the curving line.
But truly, truly, it’s not my fault, or only my fault a little bit,” she said, daintily drawling the words “a little bit.” “Oh, how like Stiva you said that!” said Dolly, laughing.
“No, I don’t smoke,” Alexey Alexandrovitch answered calmly, and as though purposely wishing to show that he was not afraid of the subject, he turned to Pestsov with a chilly smile.
The money is ready conclusively to the last farthing.
“Yes, but you must care to say good-bye to a man who has shot himself on your account....” “That’s just why I don’t want to.” With a dismayed and guilty expression, Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped and would have gone back unobserved.
He feels it, that’s evident.” “He?” she said sneeringly.
But, contrary to his usual habit, he did not go to bed, he walked up and down his study till three o’clock in the morning.
Levin knew all this; and it was agonizingly painful to him to behold the supplicating, hopeful eyes and the emaciated wrist, lifted with difficulty, making the sign of the cross on the tense brow, and the prominent shoulders and hollow, gasping chest, which one could not feel consistent with the life the sick man was praying for.
“You won’t dine at home?” said Matvey, seeing him off.
“Oh!
“Well, what is it, Matrona?” queried Stepan Arkadyevitch, going up to her at the door.
And with these memories was now ranged his rejection and the pitiful position in which he must have appeared to others that evening.
Again and again she went over in her memory all her relations with the family.
The efforts she had made to like it seemed to her intolerable, and she felt a longing to get back quickly into the fresh air, to Russia, to Ergushovo, where, as she knew from letters, her sister Dolly had already gone with her children.
Two were already riding forward to the point from which they were to start.
Linon, and looked towards him with a smile of quiet affection, as though he were a favorite brother.
Hi, wine!” he shouted, in his rich voice, that always rang out so loudly at drill, and set the windows shaking now.
Shake hands on it.” And the baroness, detaining Vronsky, began telling him, with many jokes, about her last new plans of life, asking his advice.
Just now, when Levin, under the influence of the thoughts that had come to him, and Agafea Mihalovna’s hint, was in a troubled and uncertain humor, the meeting with his brother that he had to face seemed particularly difficult.
“Give him your hand.
“No; why, as it is, I have danced more at your ball in Moscow than I have all the winter in Petersburg,” said Anna, looking round at Vronsky, who stood near her.
The trifling fact that, thinning out his rye, the old man used the rye he thinned out for his horses, specially struck Levin.
Oh, it is nice, delicious!
“You want it, I expect?” “No, I don’t ... yes, I do,” she said, not looking at him, and crimsoning to the roots of her hair.
“Yes, but what is a girl to do who has no family?” put in Stepan Arkadyevitch, thinking of Masha Tchibisova, whom he had had in his mind all along, in sympathizing with Pestsov and supporting him.
This would never have been if I weren’t bad.
Stepan Arkadyevitch was fond of a joke: “And maybe she will come round!
He did not sleep half the night, thinking over in detail the putting of his idea into practice.
“This is my position: you can trample me in the mud, make me the laughing-stock of the world, I will not abandon her, and I will never utter a word of reproach to you,” Alexey Alexandrovitch went on.
That never happened.
“Your honors have been diverting yourselves with the chase?
“So you sent word to the princess that we weren’t going!” he whispered to her angrily, losing his voice.
You can’t conceive how I’m resting my hopes on you.” “Have you known Vronsky long?” she asked.
Children, who’d like to race the horses with me?” The children knew Levin very little, and could not remember when they had seen him, but they experienced in regard to him none of that strange feeling of shyness and hostility which children so often experience towards hypocritical, grown-up people, and for which they are so often and miserably punished.
A group of soldiers, a quartermaster, and several subalterns came up to the balcony with Vronsky.
“Well?” “You’d better get your hair cut, it’ll weigh you down, especially at the top.” Vronsky was in fact beginning, prematurely, to get a little bald.
He smiled because he foresaw the topic the conversation would turn on, and he was glad of it.
“Well, you have an appetite!” he said, looking at his dark-red, sunburnt face and neck bent over the plate.
“I am very glad I persuaded him to receive extreme unction tomorrow,” she said, sitting in her dressing jacket before her folding looking-glass, combing her soft, fragrant hair with a fine comb.
“Oh!
Bowing in silence, he let her pass before him.
“You’re soon back again, sir,” said Agafea Mihalovna.
“Yes, but I was very much interested by your irritable neighbor,” said Levin, sighing.
Without turning round he felt the eyes fixed on him, and the smile, and he could not help turning round.
She had heard his steps and voice, and had waited at the door for Mademoiselle Linon to go.
Anna Arkadyevna had not yet come in.
“This is beyond everything.” Without answering her husband, Anna lifted her opera-glass and gazed towards the place where Vronsky had fallen; but it was so far off, and there was such a crowd of people about it, that she could make out nothing.
Not an idea in one’s brain, as empty as a drum!” But Konstantin Levin found it dull sitting and listening to him, especially when he knew that while he was away they would be carting dung onto the fields not ploughed ready for it, and heaping it all up anyhow; and would not screw the shares in the ploughs, but would let them come off and then say that the new ploughs were a silly invention, and there was nothing like the old Andreevna plough, and so on.
She would have revealed them to anyone sooner than to her mother.
“Still, it’s a pity they should get those two bears without you.
“But by marriages of prudence we mean those in which both parties have sown their wild oats already.
It is wrong, but I can’t help it, I can’t help it.” “Not you it was performed that noble act of forgiveness, at which I was moved to ecstasy, and everyone else too, but He, working within your heart,” said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, raising her eyes rapturously, “and so you cannot be ashamed of your act.” Alexey Alexandrovitch knitted his brows, and crooking his hands, he cracked his fingers.
I can’t run to hundred-pound sauces.” “She’s unique!” said the lady of the house.
The sun was already sinking into the trees when they went with their jingling dippers into the wooded ravine of Mashkin Upland.
I’d no other way out of it.
At half-past nine o’clock a particularly joyful and pleasant family conversation over the tea-table at the Oblonskys’ was broken up by an apparently simple incident.
“In that case he would have done wrong, and I should not have regretted him,” answered Varenka, evidently realizing that they were now talking not of her, but of Kitty.
Yegor listened attentively, and obviously quite took in Levin’s idea, but by way of assent to it he enunciated, greatly to Levin’s surprise, the observation that when he had lived with good masters he had always been satisfied with his masters, and now was perfectly satisfied with his employer, though he was a Frenchman.
“Do you paint?” said Golenishtchev, turning round quickly to Vronsky.
Her glance, the touch of her hand, set him aflame.
The maid, who had been listening at her door for a long while, came into her room of her own accord.
I’ll dress at once and come down.
“Isn’t it, Anna?” “It is upsetting, but one can’t tear oneself away,” said another lady.
“You will come?” Dolly called after him.
The bailiff came in, and said everything, thank God, was doing well; but informed him that the buckwheat in the new drying machine had been a little scorched.
Your action was just what it should have been.
“I mean that I’m acting for my own advantage.
I know his soul, and know that we are like him.
“You were driving to Ergushovo,” said Levin, feeling as if he would sob with the rapture that was flooding his heart.
Come, you’ll be dull alone, so go and stay at Moscow a little.” “There, you always ascribe base, vile motives to me,” she said with tears of wounded pride and fury.
He behaved with hostile courtesy, as though he were afraid of coming closer to people he did not respect.
He had enough taste for painting to be unable to finish his picture.
And in platonic love there can be no tragedy, because in that love all is clear and pure, because....” At that instant Levin recollected his own sins and the inner conflict he had lived through.
“If they knew,” he thought, bending his head with a significant air as he listened to the report, “what a guilty little boy their president was half an hour ago.” And his eyes were laughing during the reading of the report.
He looked more robust, had let his whiskers grow, but was still the same graceful creature, whose face and figure were even more striking from their softness and nobility than their beauty.
Although he said nothing to her that he could not have said before everybody, he felt that she was becoming more and more dependent upon him, and the more he felt this, the better he liked it, and the tenderer was his feeling for her.
The old man, who had put on his short sheepskin jacket, was just as good-humored, jocose, and free in his movements.
As they were walking back over the cut grass, the old man called Levin’s attention to the little girls and boys who were coming from different directions, hardly visible through the long grass, and along the road towards the mowers, carrying sacks of bread dragging at their little hands and pitchers of the sour rye-beer, with cloths wrapped round them.
The complication was of this nature: Alexey Alexandrovitch’s characteristic quality as a politician, that special individual qualification that every rising functionary possesses, the qualification that with his unflagging ambition, his reserve, his honesty, and with his self-confidence had made his career, was his contempt for red tape, his cutting down of correspondence, his direct contact, wherever possible, with the living fact, and his economy.
“Present me to your new friends,” he said to his daughter, squeezing her hand with his elbow.
No, stop a minute.
What antediluvian notions you have!
“How I knew it would be so!
His own peasants put every hindrance they could in the way of this new arrangement, but it was carried out, and the first year the meadows had yielded a profit almost double.
But I don’t want to talk of myself, and besides I can’t explain it all,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
“And it won’t run to more than twenty-five yards of fagots per acre, and he’s giving me at the rate of seventy roubles the acre.” Levin smiled contemptuously.
As he rarely met Anna, he could say nothing but commonplaces to her, but he said those commonplaces as to when she was returning to Petersburg, and how fond Countess Lidia Ivanovna was of her, with an expression which suggested that he longed with his whole soul to please her and show his regard for her and even more than that.
“He came to me too late, or I’d have fixed the price for him.” Ryabinin got up, and in silence, with a smile, he looked Levin down and up.
“Oh!
The prince had traveled a great deal, and considered one of the chief advantages of modern facilities of communication was the accessibility of the pleasures of all nations.
“Well, shall we set off?” he asked.
Well, he’s of that class.
She needed consolation.
But Stepan Arkadyevitch stopped him.
On the hillside he looked back; he could not see them in the mist that had risen from the valley; he could only hear rough, good-humored voices, laughter, and the sound of clanking scythes.
“They’ll open the door.” “No, I’ll go in from the garden.” And feeling satisfied that she was alone, and wanting to take her by surprise, since he had not promised to be there today, and she would certainly not expect him to come before the races, he walked, holding his sword and stepping cautiously over the sandy path, bordered with flowers, to the terrace that looked out upon the garden.
I made his acquaintance in Tver when I was there on official business, and he came there for the levy of recruits.
“Walk in, your excellency,” he said to Levin; by way of showing his respect to Stepan Arkadyevitch, being attentive to his guest as well.
They prayed, as they always do, for peace from on high and for salvation, for the Holy Synod, and for the Tsar; they prayed, too, for the servants of God, Konstantin and Ekaterina, now plighting their troth.
No, everything is over, everything that once made my comfort, the reward of my work, and my sufferings.... Would you believe it, I was teaching Grisha just now: once this was a joy to me, now it is a torture.
That chasm was life itself, the bridge that artificial life in which Alexey Alexandrovitch had lived.
Kitty listened to the words of the prayer, trying to make out their meaning, but she could not.
Levin knew his brother and the workings of his intellect: he knew that his unbelief came not from life being easier for him without faith, but had grown up because step by step the contemporary scientific interpretation of natural phenomena crushed out the possibility of faith; and so he knew that his present return was not a legitimate one, brought about by way of the same working of his intellect, but simply a temporary, interested return to faith in a desperate hope of recovery.
Levin tried to drink coffee and put some roll in his mouth, but his mouth was quite at a loss what to do with the roll.
“Send to Sury, to Tchefirovka; if they don’t come we must look for them.” “Oh, I’ll send, to be sure,” said Vassily Fedorovitch despondently.
“However happy you may be, you must regret your freedom.” “And confess there is a feeling that you want to jump out of the window, like Gogol’s bridegroom?” “Of course there is, but it isn’t confessed,” said Katavasov, and he broke into loud laughter.
“If our husbands didn’t talk to us, we should see the facts as they are.
“You’ve not been to see us for a long while.” “I was here yesterday, but at the other entrance.
She had done all she could—she had run up to him and given herself up entirely, shy and happy.
He did not even like to look at it, and had only brought it out because he was expecting an Englishman who wanted to buy it.
And the smallest, Lily, was bewitching in her naïve astonishment at everything, and it was difficult not to smile when, after taking the sacrament, she said in English, “Please, some more.” On the way home the children felt that something solemn had happened, and were very sedate.
She had been ill, and as spring came on she grew worse.
He saw the uncertainty in the mare’s ears and lifted the whip, but at the same time felt that his fears were groundless; the mare knew what was wanted.
He did say: ‘Maybe I’ll go to the waters, or maybe I’ll come down to you.’” He felt dismayed and vexed for the first minute, that his brother Nikolay’s presence should come to disturb his happy mood of spring.
“I don’t understand it at all,” said Levin, blushing, and feeling that his words were stupid, and that they could not be anything but stupid in such a position.
“What sense is there in murdering a man in order to define one’s relation to a guilty wife and son?
You ought to go to some warm springs, especially now you’re ready for the journey.” “Well, I am going away the day after tomorrow, Agafea Mihalovna; I must finish my work.” “There, there, your work, you say!
Levin, too, could not help smiling.
She took off her hat, and, morally speaking, tucked up her sleeves and prepared for action.
But Natalia, too, had hardly made her appearance in the world when she married the diplomat Lvov.
“Excuse me, your excellency, for venturing to trouble you.
He takes away his hands and feels the shamestruck and idiotic expression of his face.
During the service he would first listen to the prayers, trying to attach some meaning to them not discordant with his own views; then feeling that he could not understand and must condemn them, he tried not to listen to them, but to attend to the thoughts, observations, and memories which floated through his brain with extreme vividness during this idle time of standing in church.
And death, which was here in this loved brother, groaning half asleep and from habit calling without distinction on God and the devil, was not so remote as it had hitherto seemed to him.
Kitty looked at all of them with the same absent eyes as Levin.
She gazed rather a long while at him without answering, and, in spite of the shadow in which he was standing, she saw, or fancied she saw, both the expression of his face and his eyes.
Besides, he saw that if it came to talking about technique, it was impossible to praise him for it.
Except deceit and lying nothing could come of it now; and deceit and lying were opposed to his nature.
He’s a nice child, like our host here.
They were just reaching the dammed-up stream on their way to the starting point.
“No, you’ve not got a true impression of Levin.
“Let’s stay a little while,” answered Levin.
He prescribed more physical exercise as far as possible, and as far as possible less mental strain, and above all no worry—in other words, just what was as much out of Alexey Alexandrovitch’s power as abstaining from breathing.
Levin was of the opinion of Darya Alexandrovna that a girl who did not marry should find a woman’s duties in a family.
To explain to Stepan Arkadyevitch the state of excitement in which he found himself, he said that he was happy like a dog being trained to jump through a hoop, who, having at last caught the idea, and done what was required of him, whines and wags its tail, and jumps up to the table and the windows in its delight.
“How is your mistress?” “A successful confinement yesterday.” Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped short and turned white.
And, not letting his comrade enter into further details of his position, Petritsky proceeded to tell him all the interesting news.
“What makes you think,” said Levin, trying to get back to the question, “that it’s impossible to find some relation to the laborer in which the labor would become productive?” “That never could be so with the Russian peasantry; we’ve no power over them,” answered the landowner.
And the children feel it so: Learning French and unlearning sincerity,” he thought to himself, unaware that Darya Alexandrovna had thought all that over twenty times already, and yet, even at the cost of some loss of sincerity, believed it necessary to teach her children French in that way.
“Your tone of contempt for us poor townsfolk!...
Pray to God,” he repeated hurriedly.
You are so distressed, so overwrought, that you look at many things mistakenly.” Dolly grew calmer, and for two minutes both were silent.
He felt as he swung his scythe that he was at the very end of his strength, and was making up his mind to ask Tit to stop.
Levin could not help recalling every word he had said, and in imagination amending his own replies.
Peace was made.
“The great change is that she brought back with her the shadow of Alexey Vronsky,” said the ambassador’s wife.
I should hope our friendship rises above all that sort of thing.
Anna pondered for an instant in uncertainty.
The nurse was an old servant of the family.
He painted with her as his model, admired her beauty and mediævalism, and Anna dared not confess to herself that she was afraid of becoming jealous of this nurse, and was for that reason particularly gracious and condescending both to her and her little son.
At every step he found his former dreams disappointed, and new, unexpected surprises of happiness.
But her affection for Varenka did not wane.
He was impatiently looking forward to the news that she was married, or just going to be married, hoping that such news would, like having a tooth out, completely cure him.
But by now this lodge was old and dilapidated.
“O Lord!” he murmured, and sighed deeply.
What business had I to interfere with outsiders?
“No, not very,” he said.
When Alexey Alexandrovitch had made up his mind that he must talk to his wife about it, it had seemed a very easy and simple matter.
“How do you mean?” offended that he should seem to take her suggestion unwillingly and with vexation.
At dinner ... yesterday, I was almost getting up from the dinner-table.
“No!” he shrieked, in his shrill voice, which pitched a note higher than usual even, and his big hands clutching her by the arm so violently that red marks were left from the bracelet he was squeezing, he forcibly sat her down in her place.
“Dolly, what can I say?...
Having heard all the news, Vronsky, with the assistance of his valet, got into his uniform, and went off to report himself.
“Sir John!
He can’t get up.
“There are laws, madam, and since you’ve challenged me to it, I’ll tell you who’s to blame for it all: you and you, you and nobody else.
In the house they were only just up, and the cook came out to go marketing.
Levin obediently helped himself to sauce, but would not let Stepan Arkadyevitch go on with his dinner.
“Well, anyway, I may say that I’m very glad of it.” “That you may do tomorrow, tomorrow and nothing more!
Petritsky lived with him in camp too.
And always the same people, always the same.
All were good, pleasant.
“Right!” he pronounced all at once reassuringly, as though all were solved for him.
They get a glimpse of red lips under a short veil, and exquisite little feet.” “You describe it with such feeling that I fancy you must be one of the two.” “And after what you said, just now!
Sviazhsky questioned him about his improvements on his estate, presupposing, as he always did, that there was no possibility of doing anything not done already in Europe, and now this did not in the least annoy Levin.
In reality, those who in Vronsky’s opinion had the “proper” view had no sort of view at all, but behaved in general as well-bred persons do behave in regard to all the complex and insoluble problems with which life is encompassed on all sides; they behaved with propriety, avoiding allusions and unpleasant questions.
And I, instead of going to seek him out, went out to dinner, and came here.” Levin walked up to a lamppost, read his brother’s address, which was in his pocketbook, and called a sledge.
“Very charming,” said the countess.
When he reached the point about the fundamental and radical law, his opponent jumped up and began to protest.
Political economy told him that the laws by which the wealth of Europe had been developed, and was developing, were universal and unvarying.
Perhaps it will pass off.” “But you mustn’t think about it.” “I can’t help it.
Oblonsky noticed this at once, and smiled.
“Don’t put yourself out; we shall get it all done in time.” Levin waved his hand angrily, went into the granary to glance at the oats, and then to the stable.
how explain, how find out her wishes?” “If you will allow me to give my opinion, I think that it lies with you to point out directly the steps you consider necessary to end the position.” “So you consider it must be ended?” Alexey Alexandrovitch interrupted him.
I must disappoint you ... but he has not missed you as your husband has.
He was going to see his wife, because he had determined to see her once a week to keep up appearances.
“And the worst of all is, you see, that I can’t cast him off: there are the children, I am tied.
Chapter 9 The old neglected palazzo, with its lofty carved ceilings and frescoes on the walls, with its floors of mosaic, with its heavy yellow stuff curtains on the windows, with its vases on pedestals, and its open fireplaces, its carved doors and gloomy reception rooms, hung with pictures—this palazzo did much, by its very appearance after they had moved into it, to confirm in Vronsky the agreeable illusion that he was not so much a Russian country gentleman, a retired army officer, as an enlightened amateur and patron of the arts, himself a modest artist who had renounced the world, his connections, and his ambition for the sake of the woman he loved.
There, too, she descried Stiva, and there she saw the exquisite figure and head of Anna in a black velvet gown.
But intriguing people have to invent a noxious, dangerous party.
Then he took out of his notebook three notes of Anna’s, read them again, burned them, and remembering their conversation on the previous day, he sank into meditation.
But his relations with these people were confined to one clearly defined channel, and had a certain routine from which it was impossible to depart.
And I can’t....” “Never mind, we’ll slip something under and pull you out.
But with me, it’s another thing; I see through his ideas, and I know where its weakness lies.” Everyone was mute.
The applicability or non-applicability of the Christian precept to his own case was too difficult a question to be discussed lightly, and this question had long ago been answered by Alexey Alexandrovitch in the negative.
“Kitty!
But here it seemed to Levin that just as they were close upon the real point of the matter, they were again retreating, and he made up his mind to put a question to the professor.
Sappho Shtoltz you don’t know?
And do you know, stand-shooting in the morning is unusually good—why not go?
waltz!” shouted Korsunsky from the other side of the room, and seizing the first young lady he came across he began dancing himself.
what have I done!” he cried.
And then eight hundred acres of wheat, three hundred of potatoes, and four hundred of clover, and not one acre exhausted.
“Now, Kostya, you have to decide,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch with an air of mock dismay, “a weighty question.
The two footmen and Matvey, in white cravats, did their duty with the dishes and wines unobtrusively, quietly, and swiftly.
“How do you mean?” “Like this,” she said, tugging at the folds of her woolen skirt.
If he’d killed me, if he’d killed him, I could have borne anything, I could have forgiven anything; but, no, he.... How was it I didn’t guess what he would do?
Gladiator and Diana came up to it together and almost at the same instant; simultaneously they rose above the stream and flew across to the other side; Frou-Frou darted after them, as if flying; but at the very moment when Vronsky felt himself in the air, he suddenly saw almost under his mare’s hoofs Kuzovlev, who was floundering with Diana on the further side of the stream.
I arrived,” answered Levin, in his emotion not at once understanding her question.
The idea of a duel had never crossed her mind, and so she put a different interpretation on this passing expression of hardness.
Chapter 8 Towards the end of May, when everything had been more or less satisfactorily arranged, she received her husband’s answer to her complaints of the disorganized state of things in the country.
In the following cases: physical defect in the married parties, desertion without communication for five years,” he said, crooking a short finger covered with hair, “adultery” (this word he pronounced with obvious satisfaction), “subdivided as follows” (he continued to crook his fat fingers, though the three cases and their subdivisions could obviously not be classified together): “physical defect of the husband or of the wife, adultery of the husband or of the wife.” As by now all his fingers were used up, he uncrooked all his fingers and went on: “This is the theoretical view; but I imagine you have done me the honor to apply to me in order to learn its application in practice.
I am to blame, no words can express how much I am to blame!
Well, and what do you mean to do with me?” “I suppose you had better stay here, Alexander,” said his wife.
Bitter memories were more and more covered up by the incidents—paltry in his eyes, but really important—of his country life.
“Kouzma, get ready the trap,” and he ran downstairs.
And those who only know the non-platonic love have no need to talk of tragedy.
She, pleased and happy after her conversation with her daughter, had gone to the prince to say good-night as usual, and though she had no intention of telling him of Levin’s offer and Kitty’s refusal, still she hinted to her husband that she fancied things were practically settled with Vronsky, and that he would declare himself so soon as his mother arrived.
This he used to call his day of reckoning or _faire la lessive_.
“And this woman,” Nikolay Levin interrupted him, pointing to her, “is the partner of my life, Marya Nikolaevna.
At the other end sat the prince, eating heartily, and talking loudly and merrily.
But what did pass between you?
Alexey Alexandrovitch was busily engaged with them for a long while, drew up a program for them from which they were not to depart, and on dismissing them wrote a letter to Petersburg for the guidance of the deputation.
The _soupe Marie-Louise_ was a splendid success; the tiny pies eaten with it melted in the mouth and were irreproachable.
Yes, but then, Darmstadt was in America.
It made him uncomfortable, and it positively annoyed him to see his brother’s attitude to the country.
Stepan Arkadyevitch told his wife the cause of the delay, and the guests were whispering it with smiles to one another.
“But the shirt!” cried Levin.
That’s her manner.... Come, boy, the soup!...
“Very ill,” he answered.
“He’s always out; I scarcely ever see him,” she could not resist adding with a sarcastic smile.
what for?” thought Alexey Alexandrovitch, remembering the details of divorce proceedings in which the husband took the blame on himself, and with just the same gesture with which Vronsky had done the same, he hid his face for shame in his hands.
And, as he had done every day for the last nine years, he stretched out his hand, without getting up, towards the place where his dressing-gown always hung in his bedroom.
And again she felt that everything was split in two in her soul.
“I’ve been to see you.” “A meeting for one minute, for I’m going,” said Betsy, smiling and putting on her glove.
But after seeing his brother, listening to his conversation with the professor, hearing afterwards the unconsciously patronizing tone in which his brother questioned him about agricultural matters (their mother’s property had not been divided, and Levin took charge of both their shares), Levin felt that he could not for some reason begin to talk to him of his intention of marrying.
Going into the hall he saw a handsome groom, in a braided livery and a bear fur cape, holding a white fur cloak.
“Now, children, run along, run along.
You like horses—and you have them; dogs—you have them; shooting—you have it; farming—you have it.” “Perhaps because I rejoice in what I have, and don’t fret for what I haven’t,” said Levin, thinking of Kitty.
“Oh, yes, that’s the best method!” he said, munching cheese and filling the wine-glass with a special sort of spirit.
Levin smiled.
And his face expressed serious hesitation.
She felt a feeling such as she had known in childhood, when she had been shut in her room as a punishment, and had heard her sisters’ merry laughter outside.
They write me that Kitty Shtcherbatskaya’s very ill.” “Really?” said Vronsky, knitting his brows.
and so there’s no help for it.” “But why can’t you?
It was in himself too, he felt that.
“Take the bride’s hand and lead her up,” the best man said to Levin.
“And still no sign of my brother.” “Do call him, Alexey,” said the old countess.
That figure lived, and was clearly and unmistakably defined.
Or has he had his hair cut?” Precisely at twelve o’clock, when Anna was still sitting at her writing-table, finishing a letter to Dolly, she heard the sound of measured steps in slippers, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, freshly washed and combed, with a book under his arm, came in to her.
“I’ve not read it,” Kritsky responded gloomily, obviously not desiring to enter into the conversation.
He began to look at his picture with all his own full artist vision, and was soon in that mood of conviction of the perfectibility, and so of the significance, of his picture—a conviction essential to the most intense fervor, excluding all other interests—in which alone he could work.
It was decided that they should go together the next day.
Anna was aware from his eyes that he liked looking at her, but he avoided conversation with her.
“It won’t come as we suppose.
He could not go to bed, feeling that it was absolutely needful for him first to think thoroughly over the position that had just arisen.
“Anna, it’s necessary for me to have a talk with you.” “With me?” she said, wonderingly.
“It’s all right, sir; she will come round,” said Matvey.
She saw in him sympathy for her, but not love.
“Parfen Denisitch now, for all he was no scholar, he died a death that God grant everyone of us the like,” she said, referring to a servant who had died recently.
This was not what she had been reckoning on.
Here he is!” said the midwife, trying to attract her attention to Alexey Alexandrovitch.
He turned over his stout, well-cared-for person on the springy sofa, as though he would sink into a long sleep again; he vigorously embraced the pillow on the other side and buried his face in it; but all at once he jumped up, sat up on the sofa, and opened his eyes.
But I must be going,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting up for the tenth time.
I hear you, but I am thinking of him.
She determined that she would get the smaller part of the trousseau all ready now, and the larger part should be made later, and she was much vexed with Levin because he was incapable of giving her a serious answer to the question whether he agreed to this arrangement or not.
I’ll ring.” “What can I write?” she thought.
Masha promised to write to Konstantin in case of need, and to persuade Nikolay Levin to go and stay with his brother.
A boy.
Leaving the school very young as a brilliant officer, he had at once got into the circle of wealthy Petersburg army men.
What do you think of that?
In the very doorway Vronsky almost ran up against Alexey Alexandrovitch.
Perhaps it’s our strong point, really, the faculty of seeing our own shortcomings; but we overdo it, we comfort ourselves with irony which we always have on the tip of our tongues.
“All right, I’ll go by the forest.” And Levin rode through the slush of the farmyard to the gate and out into the open country, his good little horse, after his long inactivity, stepping out gallantly, snorting over the pools, and asking, as it were, for guidance.
She longed to turn back and send him a letter to come and see her, or to go herself to see him.
What makes men go out of their minds; what makes men shoot themselves?” he answered himself, and opening his eyes, he saw with wonder an embroidered cushion beside him, worked by Varya, his brother’s wife.
As they left the pavilion, Alexey Alexandrovitch, as always, talked to those he met, and Anna had, as always, to talk and answer; but she was utterly beside herself, and moved hanging on her husband’s arm as though in a dream.
“Ah!
The doctor was extremely dissatisfied with Alexey Alexandrovitch.
You can’t imagine what loathsome thoughts I have about everything.” “Why, whatever loathsome thoughts can you have?” asked Dolly, smiling.
Levin bowed to her, and said nothing.
What do you think, isn’t it time to start, Kostya?” he added.
Tried it: worse.
After having some lunch, he lay down on the sofa immediately, and in five minutes memories of the hideous scenes he had witnessed during the last few days were confused together and joined on to a mental image of Anna and of the peasant who had played an important part in the bear hunt, and Vronsky fell asleep.
“I ask one thing only: I ask for the right to hope, to suffer as I do.
Katavasov, feeling his originality was appreciated and understood, made the most of it.
They could neither of them eat, however, and for a long while they could not sleep, and did not even go to bed.
He’ll keep himself in the right, while me, in my ruin, he’ll drive still lower to worse ruin yet....” She recalled the words from the letter.
He could not yet make out what had happened, when the white legs of a chestnut horse flashed by close to him, and Mahotin passed at a swift gallop.
“They’re not here,” she said, shutting the drawer; but from that action he saw he had guessed right, and roughly pushing away her hand, he quickly snatched a portfolio in which he knew she used to put her most important papers.
They assumed an air of fully comprehending the import and force of the situation, of accepting and even approving of it, but of considering it superfluous and uncalled for to put all this into words.
“I rejoice, because things cannot, cannot possibly remain as he supposes.” “Why can’t they?” Anna said, restraining her tears, and obviously attaching no sort of consequence to what he said.
Together!” cried Levin, and he ran with Laska into the thicket to look for the snipe.
“I’m not the first nor the last.” And to say nothing of historical instances dating from the “Fair Helen” of Menelaus, recently revived in the memory of all, a whole list of contemporary examples of husbands with unfaithful wives in the highest society rose before Alexey Alexandrovitch’s imagination.
He waited.
She could not frame a thought, not a wish apart from life with this man; but this new life was not yet, and she could not even picture it clearly to herself.
“Is madame at home or not?” “Madame has been out for a walk but has returned now,” answered the waiter.
“Yes, yes!” he said, “it’s very possible you’re right.
This exasperated and tortured Golenishtchev, but Vronsky was incapable of deceiving and torturing himself, and even more incapable of exasperation.
“I’m not going,” said Liza, smiling and settling herself close to Anna.
We met at Rossi’s, do you remember, at that _soirée_ when that Italian lady recited—the new Rachel?” Golenishtchev answered easily, removing his eyes without the slightest regret from the picture and turning to the artist.
When, just before entering the ballroom, the princess, her mother, tried to turn right side out of the ribbon of her sash, Kitty had drawn back a little.
And could you see if my brother is here, and send him to me?” said the lady in the doorway, and stepped back again into the compartment.
At first there was the sound of merry talk and laughing all together over the supper, then singing again and laughter.
He always felt something special moving him to the quick at the hay-making.
“No, Stiva,” she said, “I’m lost, lost!
“Kouzma, give me my sheepskin.
“Where do I come from?” he said, in answer to a question from the ambassador’s wife.
“Delightful child, delightful!
“Remember one thing, that I needed nothing but forgiveness, and I want nothing more.... Why doesn’t _he_ come?” she said, turning to the door towards Vronsky.
Vaska bowed to the two ladies, and glanced at them, but only for one second.
But in spite of all this Levin thought the system worked, and that by keeping accounts strictly and insisting on his own way, he would prove to them in the future the advantages of the arrangement, and then the system would go of itself.
Like an ox with head bent, submissively he awaited the blow which he felt was lifted over him.
“Darya Alexandrovna,” he said, “that’s how one chooses a new dress or some purchase or other, not love.
“What do you want?” she said in a rapid, deep, unnatural voice.
“I have doubted, I doubt everything,” said Levin in a voice that jarred on himself, and he ceased speaking.
“I am glad it has all ended so satisfactorily, and that you are back again,” he went on.
“You take Seryozha to hurt me,” she said, looking at him from under her brows.
And there’s no one I could speak of it to, except you.
“Kitty, what is it?” said Countess Nordston, stepping noiselessly over the carpet towards her.
The only point of interest was that it was settled they should go abroad.
Stepping noiselessly over the thick rugs, he went up to Princess Myakaya.
12 was half open, and there came out into the streak of light thick fumes of cheap, poor tobacco, and the sound of a voice, unknown to Levin; but he knew at once that his brother was there; he heard his cough.
Ah!
He tried to say this.
worse than lost!
“I did inform you about the machine.” This question was enough to take Levin back to all the details of his work on the estate, which was on a large scale, and complicated.
This horror had in his youth set him pondering on dueling, and picturing himself in a position in which he would have to expose his life to danger.
Russia needs men; she needs a party, or else everything goes and will go to the dogs.” “How do you mean?
She had an aim in life.
He cherished a grudge against Madame Stahl for not making his acquaintance.
Well, to be sure, please God, the hay’s good.
There have been slaves first everywhere, then metayers; and we have the half-crop system, rent, and day laborers.
Involuntarily he talked to her in his habitual tone of jeering at anyone who should say what he was saying.
But when she arrived, he did not meet her.
Above all, it seemed strange and not right to Anna.
Anna looked out of the window and saw Alexey Alexandrovitch’s courier on the steps, ringing at the front door bell.
“Yes, my solitude is over.
Ivan Parmenov was standing on the cart, taking, laying in place, and stamping down the huge bundles of hay, which his pretty young wife deftly handed up to him, at first in armfuls, and then on the pitchfork.
“There, that’s enough, that’s enough!
Anna found it difficult now to recall the feeling of almost awe-stricken reverence which she had at first entertained for these persons.
No one ever spoke to her so but the justices of the peace who tried her for trying to get out of a house of ill-fame.
Sergey Ivanovitch was a Moscow man, and a philosopher; Alexey Alexandrovitch a Petersburger, and a practical politician.
I beg your pardon,” he added, and he turned to the adjutant: “Please have this divided from me, each man as much as it runs to.” And he hurriedly took notes for three hundred roubles from his pocketbook, blushing a little.
I pray to God only not to take from me the bliss of forgiveness!” Tears stood in his eyes, and the luminous, serene look in them impressed Vronsky.
And that’s what I wanted to see you for.
The immense stretch of meadow had been mown and was sparkling with a peculiar fresh brilliance, with its lines of already sweet-smelling grass in the slanting rays of the evening sun.
“You’ve been quick about it!” said Oblonsky with a smile.
Tears of shame and despair choked her utterance.
She got up to rouse herself, and slipped off her plaid and the cape of her warm dress.
I foresaw nothing, and now I understand nothing.” “Dear friend,” repeated Lidia Ivanovna.
She loves me!
Afterwards, on a day fixed beforehand, the expected offer was made to her parents, and accepted.
The snipe had ceased flying; but Levin resolved to stay a little longer, till Venus, which he saw below a branch of birch, should be above it, and the stars of the Great Bear should be perfectly plain.
“You’re back from leave, I suppose?” he said, and without waiting for a reply, he turned to his wife in his jesting tone: “Well, were a great many tears shed at Moscow at parting?” By addressing his wife like this he gave Vronsky to understand that he wished to be left alone, and, turning slightly towards him, he touched his hat; but Vronsky turned to Anna Arkadyevna.
“Yes; but in that case, if you will allow me to say what I think....
Ivan jumped down and took the quiet, sleek horse by the bridle.
“Just now I’m reading Duc de Lille, _Poésie des Enfers,_” he answered.
He was attired as though for a wedding, from his cravat to his double watch-chain and varnished boots.
“Well, tell me all about it.” And Stepan Arkadyevitch began to tell his story.
What are you coming for?” she said, letting fall the hand with which she had grasped the door post.
“How those figures in the background stand out!
These were Sergey Ivanovitch, Katavasov, a university friend, now professor of natural science, whom Levin had met in the street and insisted on taking home with him, and Tchirikov, his best man, a Moscow conciliation-board judge, Levin’s companion in his bear-hunts.
“No, we’d better go back,” she added, noticing Levin coming towards them with his companion and a German doctor, to whom he was talking very noisily and angrily.
with what object?” said Varenka gently.
It’s even more senseless.
At last one of the ladies, glancing at her watch, said, “It really is strange, though!” and all the guests became uneasy and began loudly expressing their wonder and dissatisfaction.
“Oh, where are you going, my lord?” he asked suddenly, using the title “my lord,” which he had scarcely ever used before.
The pain she had caused herself and her husband in uttering those words would be rewarded now by everything being made clear, she thought.
I saw Stiva when he was in love with you.
Most terrible of all had been his ludicrous, shameful position when Alexey Alexandrovitch had pulled his hands away from his humiliated face.
And so for this first and most important division he must have four thousand roubles.
And he had been indeed caught unawares, and at the first moment when she spoke to him of her position, his heart had prompted him to beg her to leave her husband.
He read the books lent him by Sviazhsky, and copying out what he had not got, he read both the economic and socialistic books on the subject, but, as he had anticipated, found nothing bearing on the scheme he had undertaken.
He saw it, and his face expressed that utter subjection, that slavish devotion, which had done so much to win her.
He ran into the room with the same feeling, with an even stronger feeling than he had had when he reached the Shtcherbatskys’ house to make his offer.
“And how well things were going up till now!
I dare say I shall manage to keep it up....” “Really!
What can a man write of justice who knows nothing of it?
“There is no deceit she would stick at.
But when it comes to business, we do it better than anyone.
Although his artistic sense was unceasingly at work collecting materials, although he felt a continually increasing excitement as the moment of criticizing his work drew nearer, he rapidly and subtly formed, from imperceptible signs, a mental image of these three persons.
There’s so much that’s interesting now in Germany,” said Marya Yevgenyevna.
He went back himself to a double birch tree on the other side, and leaning his gun on the fork of a dead lower branch, he took off his full overcoat, fastened his belt again, and worked his arms to see if they were free.
But he said not at all what he had to say.
He wrote ten notes, and tore them all up, and sent the saddle without any reply.
Wasted and flushed, with a peculiar glitter in her eyes, left there by the agony of shame she had been put through, Kitty stood in the middle of the room.
Think for me, Anna, help me.
Alexander Vronsky smiled gaily.
Besides, they’re received everywhere, and _I_”—she laid special stress on the I—“have never been strict and intolerant.
I have thought over everything, and I see nothing.” Anna could think of nothing, but her heart responded instantly to each word, to each change of expression of her sister-in-law.
Why did she fix on this place to meet me, and why does she write in Betsy’s letter?” he thought, wondering now for the first time at it.
“Brainless beef!
Vronsky in amazement raised his head, and stared, as he knew how to stare, not into the Englishman’s eyes, but at his forehead, astounded at the impertinence of his question.
If he could have heard what her parents were saying that evening, if he could have put himself at the point of view of the family and have heard that Kitty would be unhappy if he did not marry her, he would have been greatly astonished, and would not have believed it.
what was I thinking about?
“Well, did you like it?” Sergey Ivanovitch asked him.
Vronsky and he had gone completely different ways on leaving the corps, and had only met once since.
In spite of all he had seen, Alexey Alexandrovitch still did not allow himself to consider his wife’s real condition.
In spite of Stepan Arkadyevitch’s efforts to be an attentive father and husband, he never could keep in his mind that he had a wife and children.
Meanwhile spring came on, beautiful and kindly, without the delays and treacheries of spring,—one of those rare springs in which plants, beasts, and man rejoice alike.
The men stood round the strong-smelling spirits and salt delicacies, and the discussion of the Russification of Poland between Koznishev, Karenin, and Pestsov died down in anticipation of dinner.
But, Dolly, darling, I fully realize your sufferings, only there is one thing I don’t know; I don’t know ...
He staggered as he said this, and then repeated the motion, trying to make it seem as if it had been intentional.
What a spring we’re having!
“Keep your hands still, Grisha,” she said, and she took up her work, a coverlet she had long been making.
“As you like.” They were standing now about fifteen paces from one another.
But the nearer the time of departure came, the bitterer was the sacrifice he was making to what he thought his duty.
She was aware of her husband approaching a long way off, and she could not help following him in the surging crowd in the midst of which he was moving.
Betsy made haste to introduce her to Anna.
And no one understands it except me, and no one ever will; and I can’t explain it.
I do it not from myself....” “I cannot help thanking you.” “But, dear friend, do not give way to the feeling of which you spoke—being ashamed of what is the Christian’s highest glory: _he who humbles himself shall be exalted_.
At the very instant he was going away I would have turned him back and told him, but I changed my mind, because it was strange that I had not told him the first minute.
Why do you keep fidgeting, why don’t you go to sleep?” his brother’s voice called to him.
Those six weeks had for her been a time of the utmost bliss and the utmost misery.
Seeing that he was powerless to begin the conversation, she began herself.
He watched how Mishka strode along, swinging the huge clods of earth that clung to each foot; and getting off his horse, he took the sieve from Vassily and started sowing himself.
On beginning to talk to the peasants about it, and making a proposition to cede them the land on new terms, he came into collision with the same great difficulty that they were so much absorbed by the current work of the day, that they had not time to consider the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed scheme.
It’s not my feeling, but a sort of force outside me has taken possession of me.
And that can only rest on a basis of freedom on both sides.” “Divorce,” Alexey Alexandrovitch interrupted, in a tone of aversion.
He had never clearly thought out the subject, but he had vaguely conceived that his wife must long ago have suspected him of being unfaithful to her, and shut her eyes to the fact.
Here, for no kind of reason, you’ve made that rascal a present of thirty thousand roubles.” “Well, what should I have done?
awful!” Stepan Arkadyevitch kept repeating to himself, and he could think of nothing to be done.
If ... better say so,” he said, not looking at her.
Crowds of well-dressed people, with hats bright in the sun, swarmed about the entrance and along the well-swept little paths between the little houses adorned with carving in the Russian style.
“It’s beyond everything what’s being done in the district, according to what this doctor tells me.
I do not regret, and shall never regret, what I have done; but I have desired one thing—your good, the good of your soul—and now I see I have not attained that.
“How marvelous Christ’s expression is!” said Anna.
So it seemed, at least, to the princess.
And these two influences were not in fact without effect; though the result remained, as Vronsky had described, uncertain.
To speak of it would be to attach importance to what has no importance.” She remembered how she had told her husband of what was almost a declaration made her at Petersburg by a young man, one of her husband’s subordinates, and how Alexey Alexandrovitch had answered that every woman living in the world was exposed to such incidents, but that he had the fullest confidence in her tact, and could never lower her and himself by jealousy.
But this joyous smile at once recalled everything to him, and he grew thoughtful.
To be such a slave!” cried Levin, getting up, and unable to restrain his anger any longer.
A young man, and a very nice one, has fallen in love with her, and she, I fancy....” “Oh, yes, you fancy!
But you’re so positive you know all the lore of the forest.
He fancied that he understood what she was utterly unable to understand: how it was that, having made her husband wretched, having abandoned him and her son and lost her good name, she yet felt full of spirits, gaiety, and happiness.
There was no need whatever for me....
He saw she had been crying.
“Shall I fetch you another cup?” said she, and taking his cup she went out.
You married him without love and not knowing what love was.
“But we must really be getting along if you want to be in time at the theater.” Levin got up and escorted Kitty to the door.
She answered him, and all at once got up, furious.
As a bachelor, when he had watched other people’s married life, seen the petty cares, the squabbles, the jealousy, he had only smiled contemptuously in his heart.
Alexey Alexandrovitch had previously felt no liking for Count Anitchkin, and had always differed from him in his opinions.
But he’s dead, dead, dead!...” “How absurd you are!” said Darya Alexandrovna, looking with mournful tenderness at Levin’s excitement.
“He’s a clever fellow, and said a lot that was true.” “Oh, get along with you!
“Oh, where shall we meet?
I can’t see her!” she cried.
“You know, Kitty’s coming here, and is going to spend the summer with me.” “Really,” he said, flushing, and at once, to change the conversation, he said: “Then I’ll send you two cows, shall I?
Kitty took his hand in both hers and pressed it.
I said: ‘Let’s have music, the funeral march!’ He fairly dropped asleep on the roof over the funeral march.” “Drink it up; you positively must drink the brandy, and then seltzer water and a lot of lemon,” said Yashvin, standing over Petritsky like a mother making a child take medicine, “and then a little champagne—just a small bottle.” “Come, there’s some sense in that.
“But what’s to be done?
But now coming to the country as the head of a family, she perceived that it was all utterly unlike what she had fancied.
The family cannot be broken up by a whim, a caprice, or even by the sin of one of the partners in the marriage, and our life must go on as it has done in the past.
Could he be of any service to her?
No, I have nothing to trouble me,” she responded coldly; and she added immediately: “You haven’t seen Mlle.
“Come, take off your coat and stay a little,” said Levin, taking his hat.
Can it be that between me and this officer boy there exist, or can exist, any other relations than such as are common with every acquaintance?” She laughed contemptuously and took up her book again; but now she was definitely unable to follow what she read.
“She’s exceptionally good as an actress; one can see she’s studied Kaulbach,” said a diplomatic attaché in the group round the ambassador’s wife.
Why, for over a year he was innocent as a babe himself, and bashful too,” answered the old man.
That’s not right,” he said, and he stopped, putting his head on one side and looking at Levin with his kindly, gentle eyes.
“It’s always of you he has talked, and, besides, he has no more money left.” “Read this; Dolly writes about you,” Kitty was beginning, with a smile; but she stopped suddenly, noticing the changed expression on her husband’s face.
I want to organize....” he answered hotly.
“You asked when?
Two or three people, your husband among them, understand all the importance of the thing, but the others simply drag it down.
He knows that, and knows that I am incapable of doing that.” She recalled another sentence in the letter.
The horse, stiffening out its legs, with an effort stopped its rapid course, and the officer of the horse-guards looked round him like a man waking up from a heavy sleep, and just managed to smile.
She was worse.
I deny it.
The mere idea of his wife, his Kitty, being in the same room with a common wench, set him shuddering with horror and loathing.
Of all she saw she liked that expression most of all, and she felt that it was the center of the picture, and so praise of it would be pleasant to the artist.
“It was bound to be so,” he said, not looking at her.
It’s as fragrant as tea!” he repeated, wishing to change the subject.
I couldn’t sleep the night anyway, but I might go straight from shooting to the station.” “Capital.” Chapter 18 Although all Vronsky’s inner life was absorbed in his passion, his external life unalterably and inevitably followed along the old accustomed lines of his social and regimental ties and interests.
Never did he work with such fervor and success as when things went ill with him, and especially when he quarreled with his wife.
Then turbot with thick sauce, then ... roast beef; and mind it’s good.
“Only fancy, we all but ran over two soldiers,” she began telling them at once, using her eyes, smiling and twitching away her tail, which she flung back at one stroke all on one side.
He saw that it was not all sitting still, floating smoothly; that one had to think too, not for an instant to forget where one was floating; and that there was water under one, and that one must row; and that his unaccustomed hands would be sore; and that it was only to look at it that was easy; but that doing it, though very delightful, was very difficult.
But still he could not help struggling against it.
There was a time when I spoke of your inward attitude, but I am not speaking of that now.
Chapter 13 Levin put on his big boots, and, for the first time, a cloth jacket, instead of his fur cloak, and went out to look after his farm, stepping over streams of water that flashed in the sunshine and dazzled his eyes, and treading one minute on ice and the next into sticky mud.
“Yes, he sees it all, he understands it all, and in these words he’s telling me that though I’m ashamed, I must get over my shame.” She could not pluck up spirit to make any answer.
A smile of pleasure lighted up his face.
“Ploughing up the potatoes.
He looked at her sternly when she came in, and smiled contemptuously when she said she had been unwell.
And the bushes about the river had been cut down, and the river itself, not visible before, now gleaming like steel in its bends, and the moving, ascending, peasants, and the sharp wall of grass of the unmown part of the meadow, and the hawks hovering over the stripped meadow—all was perfectly new.
“Come, enough about it!” he said.
When the doctor came in she flushed crimson, and her eyes filled with tears.
Here it is!”—and Petritsky pulled a letter out from under the mattress, where he had hidden it.
She was sitting on a chest and making some arrangements with her maid, sorting over heaps of dresses of different colors, spread on the backs of chairs and on the floor.
She was an honorable woman who had bestowed her love upon him, and he loved her, and therefore she was in his eyes a woman who had a right to the same, or even more, respect than a lawful wife.
He had said what her soul longed to hear, though she feared it with her reason.
Everyone might know, might suspect it, but no one might dare to speak of it.
You can’t love me....
Vronsky had slighted her, and she had slighted him, Levin.
Answer it, and don’t worry about anything just before the race.
“No, do tell me why it is one can’t go to sleep, and one can’t help being bored?” “To sleep well one ought to work, and to enjoy oneself one ought to work too.” “What am I to work for when my work is no use to anybody?
The news of the death of Parfen Denisitch made a painful impression on him.
The overstrained condition which had tormented her before did not only come back, but was intensified, and reached such a pitch that she was afraid every minute that something would snap within her from the excessive tension.
At first Levin had thought of giving up the whole farming of the land just as it was to the peasants, the laborers, and the bailiff on new conditions of partnership; but he was very soon convinced that this was impossible, and determined to divide it up.
“I will communicate my decision to you by letter,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, getting up, and he clutched at the table.
And it’s all so unimportant.” “Why, what is important?” said Kitty, looking into her face with inquisitive wonder.
She felt herself clad in an impenetrable armor of falsehood.
That look said: “That’s all very well, but as God wills.” Nothing mortified Levin so much as that tone.
Anita!” he said loudly, and the swollen veins stood out like cords on his thin white neck.
Levin still kept between the young peasant and the old man.
Altogether Mihailov, with his reserved and disagreeable, as it were, hostile attitude, was quite disliked by them as they got to know him better; and they were glad when the sittings were over, and they were left with a magnificent portrait in their possession, and he gave up coming.
The business of reorganizing the farming of his land absorbed him as completely as though there would never be anything else in his life.
The benediction and announcement can take place now.
Vronsky drew the number seven.
“Yes,” said he.
How I did work at it!
A smart guard jumped out, giving a whistle, and after him one by one the impatient passengers began to get down: an officer of the guards, holding himself erect, and looking severely about him; a nimble little merchant with a satchel, smiling gaily; a peasant with a sack over his shoulder.
It was one of those things which one knows but which one can never speak of even to oneself, so terrible and shameful would it be to be mistaken.
What am I to do?
He waked up in the dark, trembling with horror, and made haste to light a candle.
What sort of time did she have?
“All right, sir,” the Englishman’s voice responded somewhere in the inside of his throat.
From his brother’s Levin went to Oblonsky’s office, and on getting news of the Shtcherbatskys from him, he drove to the place where he had been told he might find Kitty.
Stepan Arkadyevitch stood in a comically solemn pose beside his wife, took the holy picture, and telling Levin to bow down to the ground, he blessed him with his kindly, ironical smile, and kissed him three times; Darya Alexandrovna did the same, and immediately was in a hurry to get off, and again plunged into the intricate question of the destinations of the various carriages.
There had been nothing definite, but Stepan Arkadyevitch was hardly ever at home; money, too, was hardly ever forthcoming, and Dolly was continually tortured by suspicions of infidelity, which she tried to dismiss, dreading the agonies of jealousy she had been through already.
Here he is,” she said to herself, seeing his powerful, shy figure, with his shining eyes fixed on her.
“It’s tea, not hay!
She was walking rapidly towards them carrying an elegant red bag.
The prince took off his hat and moved away with his daughter.
I don’t see how we can keep on like this.
Been here long?
I’ll be bad; but anyway not a liar, a cheat.” “But who is a cheat?” said Varenka reproachfully.
“I am very glad, she seems a nice gi....” Sergey Ivanovitch was beginning.
Nothing but sham!” she said, opening and shutting the parasol.
He was silent for a little, drew out a hook, threw it in again, and turned to his brother smiling.
Levin wanted to, and could not, take part in the general conversation; saying to himself every instant, “Now go,” he still did not go, as though waiting for something.
That will be awful for me, and for her too.” “Oh, well, anyway there’s nothing awful in it for a girl.
He walked along the path towards the skating-ground, and kept saying to himself—“You mustn’t be excited, you must be calm.
But as soon as he moved, the door of his room opened and Kitty peeped out.
Every eye, every opera-glass, was turned on the brightly colored group of riders at the moment they were in line to start.
But with her father’s coming all the world in which she had been living was transformed for Kitty.
“Perhaps.
Well, what sort of bringing-up can you give your babes if you do not overcome the temptation of the devil, enticing you to infidelity?” he said, with gentle reproachfulness.
What is there to enjoy in that?
You worry about him too.” “Oh, he doesn’t even know,” she said, and suddenly a hot flush came over her face; her cheeks, her brow, her neck crimsoned, and tears of shame came into her eyes.
“Why, with you I should have got well long ago.
At the Bobrishtchevs’ one always enjoys oneself, and at the Nikitins’ too, while at the Mezhkovs’ it’s always dull.
“Dolly,” she said, “he has told me.” Dolly looked coldly at Anna; she was waiting now for phrases of conventional sympathy, but Anna said nothing of the sort.
Kitty looked with pride at her friend.
I mean today ...
One habitual feeling impelled him to get rid of the blame and to pass it on to her.
It was agonizing, but he considered he ought to tell her both these facts.
But more and more often, and with greater persistence, he watched her.
“You know that I have come to be where you are,” he said; “I can’t help it.” At that moment the wind, as it were, surmounting all obstacles, sent the snow flying from the carriage roofs, and clanked some sheet of iron it had torn off, while the hoarse whistle of the engine roared in front, plaintively and gloomily.
“And I’m not the only one,” pursued Levin.
Don’t talk about it.
The connection between all the forces of nature is felt instinctively.... It’s particulary nice if Pava’s daughter should be a red-spotted cow, and all the herd will take after her, and the other three, too!
And in token of all now being well and satisfactory, she opened her mouth a little, smacked her lips, and settling her sticky lips more comfortably about her old teeth, she sank into blissful repose.
And with what result?
The peasant’s dying of hunger, but just go and take him on as a laborer, he’ll do his best to do you a mischief, and then bring you up before the justice of the peace.” “But then you make complaints to the justice too,” said Sviazhsky.
I agree with you,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, sincerely and genially; though he was aware that in the class of those who could be bought for twopence halfpenny Levin was reckoning him too.
“What don’t you understand?” said Oblonsky, smiling as brightly as ever, and picking up a cigarette.
“What a pity!” thought Vronsky, putting up the roof of the carriage.
“I should not be able to speak to her without a feeling of reproach; I could not look at her without resentment; and she will only hate me all the more, as she’s bound to.
Though she could not recall her own words or his, she realized instinctively that the momentary conversation had brought them fearfully closer; and she was panic-stricken and blissful at it.
Darya Alexandrovna had to drive home again to fetch her curled and pomaded son, who was to carry the holy pictures after the bride.
The handsome nurse, from whom Vronsky was painting a head for his picture, was the one hidden grief in Anna’s life.
“No,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who felt a great inclination to tell Vronsky of Levin’s intentions in regard to Kitty.
The sight of his younger brother’s appearance had immediately put him in a good humor.
It is true that in the cattle-yard things went no better than before, and Ivan strenuously opposed warm housing for the cows and butter made of fresh cream, affirming that cows require less food if kept cold, and that butter is more profitable made from sour cream, and he asked for wages just as under the old system, and took not the slightest interest in the fact that the money he received was not wages but an advance out of his future share in the profits.
How can he put up with such a position?
As always happened with him during his solitude, a mass of ideas and feelings had been accumulating within him, which he could not communicate to those about him.
“Of course I don’t envy Serpuhovskoy and never could envy him; but his advancement shows me that one has only to watch one’s opportunity, and the career of a man like me may be very rapidly made.
Kitty knew that the words she had uttered in anger about her husband’s infidelity and her humiliating position had cut her poor sister to the heart, but that she had forgiven her.
While still weeping over the injustice of his punishment, he was eating the tart, and kept saying through his sobs, “Eat yourself; let’s eat it together ... together.” Tanya had at first been under the influence of her pity for Grisha, then of a sense of her noble action, and tears were standing in her eyes too; but she did not refuse, and ate her share.
“He’s killing her,” said Betsy in a whisper full of meaning.
The bones of her legs below the knees looked no thicker than a finger from in front, but were extraordinarily thick seen from the side.
It was clearly and precisely defined in the code of principles by which he was guided.
She ran on, then back, read it all through, and once more read the letter all through again from the beginning.
Alexey Alexandrovitch asserted and believed that he had never in any previous year had so much official business as that year.
“I’m much better already,” he said.
Chapter 16 All the rooms of the summer villa were full of porters, gardeners, and footmen going to and fro carrying out things.
“I didn’t think so?
His pretty, boyish face, with a twist of fresh grass bound round his hair, was all working with effort; but whenever anyone looked at him he smiled.
“That’s why I’m telling you, just because I could never let myself doubt myself for an instant,” said Anna.
“That’s something I miss in the country—music.” “No; we only came to fetch you and thank you,” she said, rewarding him with a smile that was like a gift, “for coming.
Because—excuse me—of your stupid sale....” Stepan Arkadyevitch frowned good-humoredly, like one who feels himself teased and attacked for no fault of his own.
“I used to have a very poor opinion of him too, but he, he’s an awfully nice and wonderfully good-hearted man.
“Was ever a man in such a fearful fool’s position?” he said.
And she felt so sorry for him that tears came into her eyes.
And she could not but respond with a smile—not to his words, but to the love in his eyes.
His father said he wouldn’t give him any and pay his debts.
As she said good-bye, Kitty begged her to come to them in Russia.
Why was it I wanted to tell him and did not tell him?” And in answer to this question a burning blush of shame spread over her face.
The gentleman was complaining of the peasants.
I’m terrible, but my nurse used to tell me; the holy martyr—what was her name?
And believe me, it’s of so little consequence.... We’ve all been through it.” Kitty did not speak, and her face had a stern expression.
But....” He paused, pondering whether to disclose or not to disclose his feeling to him.
Petritsky, in his overcoat, and the cavalry captain Kamerovsky, in full uniform, probably just come from duty, were sitting each side of her.
Something important?” “Wasn’t I dreadfully untidy?” she wondered, but seeing the smile of ecstasy these reminiscences called up, she felt that the impression she had made had been very good.
He knew she had been expecting him, had listened for him, and was now going back to the drawing-room.
On the table stood medicine bottles and decanters tidily arranged, and the linen needed was folded up there, and Kitty’s _broderie anglaise_.
But he was still alive, and from time to time he sighed.
Alexey Alexandrovitch!
He felt that this was rousing in his soul a feeling of anger destructive of his peace of mind and of all the good of his achievement.
The idea of reading the Gospel to criminals, as Aline did, particularly fascinated Kitty.
“Can’t he spare time to see me?” said Alexey Alexandrovitch.
And how if she really is in love, and he’s no more thinking of marriage than I am!...
I’m ordered exercise by the doctors too.
As he corrected the leg he looked continually at the figure of John in the background, which his visitors had not even noticed, but which he knew was beyond perfection.
Well, tell me, how have you been?
“Thank God!
That’s your strong point and your failing.
Pray to God that He may in His mercy aid you and have mercy on you!” he concluded.
“You’re like a hen with your chickens, Darya Alexandrovna.” “Ah, how glad I am to see you!” she said, holding out her hand to him.
“Yes,” he assented; “and Princess Tverskaya’s interference in the most difficult private affairs is utterly uncalled for.
He stopped at the door, and, taking off his cap, let her pass.
Now, too, he shook it off and continued the thread of his thoughts.
He kissed his brother once more, but he could not speak, and knew not what to say.
I can’t forgive myself that you’re unhappy!” “I unhappy?” she said, coming closer to him, and looking at him with an ecstatic smile of love.
But you remember what I’ve said to you.
“Oh, mercy on us!
“Don’t let it run so long; it’s not my fault.
He knew that a great deal of attention and care was necessary in taking off the coverings, to avoid injuring the creation itself, and to take off all the coverings; but there was no art of painting—no technique of any sort—about it.
He saw that Russia has splendid land, splendid laborers, and that in certain cases, as at the peasant’s on the way to Sviazhsky’s, the produce raised by the laborers and the land is great—in the majority of cases when capital is applied in the European way the produce is small, and that this simply arises from the fact that the laborers want to work and work well only in their own peculiar way, and that this antagonism is not incidental but invariable, and has its roots in the national spirit.
But he did not really need these documents.
There—incredibly naked—was the beauty Lidi, Korsunsky’s wife; there was the lady of the house; there shone the bald head of Krivin, always to be found where the best people were.
“Now, go and skate, go and skate.
He did this now.
“You’re always just as if you’d come out of a bath after it,” said Petritsky.
The herdsman ran gaily to get ready for the meadow.
“You can put them on, while they have dinner.” The good-looking young woman came into the outer room with the full pails dragging at her shoulders.
She recognized him, and her face lighted up with wondering delight.
Twenty years before, when Dolly was a child, the lodge had been roomy and comfortable, though, like all lodges, it stood sideways to the entrance avenue, and faced the south.
And at this recollection, Stepan Arkadyevitch, as is so often the case, was not so much annoyed at the fact itself as at the way in which he had met his wife’s words.
Levin felt that he meant to do something with his hand and was pulling it somewhere.
Levin by now was exhausted from mental strain.
He called him vigorously and urgently, and insisted on his stopping.
All that was left was a woman with short legs, who lay down because she had a bad figure, and worried patient Varenka for not arranging her rug to her liking.
“All the same he’s a good man; truthful, good-hearted, and remarkable in his own line,” Anna said to herself going back to her room, as though she were defending him to someone who had attacked him and said that one could not love him.
And the day and the strength were consecrated to labor, and that labor was its own reward.
The plump officer took up the list of wines and turned to the young officer.
What do you advise?
“But in favor of foreign travel I would urge the change of habits, the removal from conditions calling up reminiscences.
“In the stable, putting on the saddle.” In the open horse-box stood Frou-Frou, saddled ready.
Though he had a great respect for his half-brother, an author well known to all Russia, he could not endure it when people treated him not as Konstantin Levin, but as the brother of the celebrated Koznishev.
His attitude to society, too, was clear.
But how pale you are!” “Yes, I’m very weak,” she said, smiling.
We in Russia refuse to see that we are the heirs of Byzantium,” and he launched into a long and heated explanation of his views.
“The carriage is ready,” said Matvey; “but there’s someone to see you with a petition.” “Been here long?” asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.
Obviously without the slightest effort he steered clear of all subjects which might lead to embarrassment.
“How is it you don’t know?” “I don’t know.
He had been just as rude with the Sviazhskys, leaving them without saying good-bye.
“Come along, come along to him!” he said.
They take the very figure which cannot be taken for their art, and then....” “And is it true that this Mihailov is in such poverty?” asked Vronsky, thinking that, as a Russian Mæcenas, it was his duty to assist the artist regardless of whether the picture were good or bad.
On the last step he stumbled, but barely touching the ice with his hand, with a violent effort recovered himself, and skated off, laughing.
With the insight of a man of the world, from one glance at this lady’s appearance Vronsky classified her as belonging to the best society.
On hearing this Anna sat down hurriedly, and hid her face in her fan.
As to the banks, I don’t know to whom they’re any good.
Annushka and Seryozha, and only the most necessary things.
I, too, imagine that since he is going away, there is no sort of necessity for Count Vronsky to come here.
“All our own set.
“That I’ve been in love with a man who didn’t care a straw for me, and that I’m dying of love for him?
He felt, too, something swelling in his throat and twitching in his nose, and for the first time in his life he felt on the point of weeping.
“That’s just it, just it,” Princess Myakaya turned to him.
If you’d drunk four bottles yesterday as I did you’d forget where you were lying.
But he would never go to see them again either.
She went over all her Moscow recollections.
You know....” He could not go on; there was a sob in his throat.
“Get along, get along!” said the old man, hurrying after him and easily overtaking him, “I’ll mow you down, look out!” And young and old mowed away, as though they were racing with one another.
But he had no experience of lack of confidence, because he had confidence in her, and told himself that he ought to have it.
He knew that Vronsky could not be prevented from amusing himself with painting; he knew that he and all dilettanti had a perfect right to paint what they liked, but it was distasteful to him.
She is suffering so, it’s sad to see her; and besides, everything in the house is topsy-turvy.
Vronsky and Anna sat almost opposite her.
“What are you thinking?
She looked straight into his face, as though imploring him to spare her, and gave her hand.
“You heard, perhaps, about Pryatchnikov?” said Turovtsin, warmed up by the champagne he had drunk, and long waiting for an opportunity to break the silence that had weighed on him.
“I am so happy!” Not letting go his hands, she went into the drawing-room.
Kitty gazed at her in dismay as she went up.
And in return you will enjoy all the privileges of a faithful wife without fulfilling her duties.
“I am very grateful for your confidence in me.” He repeated gently in Russian the phrase he had said in Betsy’s presence in French, and sat down beside her.
Insufferably insolent and challenging was the effect in Alexey Alexandrovitch’s eyes of the black lace about the head, admirably touched in by the painter, the black hair and handsome white hand with one finger lifted, covered with rings.
My fingers—see how huge they are!
This doubt poisoned the charm of her new life.
“To be sure!
About all her figure, and especially her head, there was a certain expression of energy, and, at the same time, of softness.
He had his chief support in this affair in the Countess Lidia Ivanovna.
“But it seems it was the will of God,” he added, and as he said it felt how foolish a remark it was, and with difficulty repressed a smile at his own foolishness.
What would become of his son in case of a divorce?
“Excuse me, countess, but I really know nothing about it, and can’t tell you anything,” he said, and looked round at the officer who came in behind the lady.
“Nothing,” she answered.
It might be bad, this new position, but it would be clear; there would be no indefiniteness or falsehood about it.
Do you know I have got so fond of the Gypsies and Russian songs.” His speech had begun to falter, and he passed abruptly from one subject to another.
You can’t fancy how delightful he was!” “Well, so you’re content with your day.
He felt that the import of his speech was of such magnitude that every word of it would have weight.
“Go round tomorrow morning, make an offer in due form, and God bless you....” “Oh, do you still think of coming to me for some shooting?
Levin read in the queer, familiar handwriting: “I humbly beg you to leave me in peace.
And in that tone it was impossible to say what needed to be said to her.
what do you look like!” said Sergey Ivanovitch, for the first moment looking round with some dissatisfaction.
He intended, when he had done that, to drive to his brother’s and to Betsy’s and to pay several visits with a view to beginning to go into that society where he might meet Madame Karenina.
“What a good deed you did yesterday to our poor compatriot!” said the princess.
As the boy read, he kept twisting and trying to tear off a button that was nearly off his jacket.
There was no trace of shell, and there was stretched over fully half the sky an even cover of tiny and ever tinier cloudlets.
“I’m setting off,” he said again.
And they beheld a pretty woman in a hired sledge; she overtakes them, looks round at them, and, so they fancy anyway, nods to them and laughs.
Marya Nikolaevna’s prediction came true.
In early youth in the Corps of Pages, he had experienced the humiliation of a refusal, when he had tried, being in difficulties, to borrow money, and since then he had never once put himself in the same position again.
Not a sight of a horse or a cow.
But to be a town councilor and discuss how many dustmen are needed, and how chimneys shall be constructed in the town in which I don’t live—to serve on a jury and try a peasant who’s stolen a flitch of bacon, and listen for six hours at a stretch to all sorts of jabber from the counsel for the defense and the prosecution, and the president cross-examining my old half-witted Alioshka, ‘Do you admit, prisoner in the dock, the fact of the removal of the bacon?’ ‘Eh?’” Konstantin Levin had warmed to his subject, and began mimicking the president and the half-witted Alioshka: it seemed to him that it was all to the point.
“Really, I’m quite well, mamma.
Oo!...” he muttered, recalling everything that had happened.
“Yes, yes!” he cried in a shrill voice.
Nothing’s amiss.... All’s well.” Chapter 28 After the ball, early next morning, Anna Arkadyevna sent her husband a telegram that she was leaving Moscow the same day.
The gas jet threw its full light on the bloodless, sunken face under the black hat and on the white cravat, brilliant against the beaver of the coat.
Levin saw nothing and no one; he did not take his eyes off his bride.
The thought that if he were held in check by her tone of quiet friendliness he would end by going back again without deciding anything came into his mind, and he resolved to make a struggle against it.
She really was both innocent and corrupt, but a sweet and passive woman.
But Vronsky was startled and annoyed by the nervous irascibility with which Golenishtchev talked of the subject that engrossed him.
Splendid!” Sviazhsky went up to Levin and invited him to come round to tea with him.
The horses were allowed to stray into the wheat because not a single laborer would consent to be night-watchman, and in spite of orders to the contrary, the laborers insisted on taking turns for night duty, and Ivan, after working all day long, fell asleep, and was very penitent for his fault, saying, “Do what you will to me, your honor.” They killed three of the best calves by letting them into the clover aftermath without care as to their drinking, and nothing would make the men believe that they had been blown out by the clover, but they told him, by way of consolation, that one of his neighbors had lost a hundred and twelve head of cattle in three days.
That union can only be severed by a crime, and a crime of that nature brings its own chastisement.” “I don’t understand a word.
Only quite lately in regard to his relations with Anna, Vronsky had begun to feel that his code of principles did not fully cover all possible contingencies, and to foresee in the future difficulties and perplexities for which he could find no guiding clue.
But this great set has its subdivisions.
He’s quite well....” Chapter 31 Vronsky had not even tried to sleep all that night.
Of course I won’t avoid meeting Katerina Alexandrovna, but as far as I can, I will try to save her the annoyance of my presence.” “You are very, very absurd,” repeated Darya Alexandrovna, looking with tenderness into his face.
“He’s looking for his wife, and she’s in the middle of the pavilion.
Anna was not like a fashionable lady, nor the mother of a boy of eight years old.
All my management rests on getting the money ready for the autumn taxes, and the peasants come to me, ‘Father, master, help us!’ Well, the peasants are all one’s neighbors; one feels for them.
God is merciful; pray to God, sir, pray to God.” “Come, that’ll do, you can go,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, blushing suddenly.
But Levin saw that he simply did so from a feeling of propriety, and that his farm was in a flourishing condition.
Here was old Yermil in a very long white smock, bending forward to swing a scythe; there was a young fellow, Vaska, who had been a coachman of Levin’s, taking every row with a wide sweep.
Vronsky smiled with a look that seemed to say that he did not deny it, but he promptly changed the subject.
You wouldn’t believe what a pleasure it is!
The plump officer rose submissively, and they moved towards the door.
Levin counted the carts, and was pleased that all that were wanted had been brought, and at the sight of the meadows his thoughts passed to the mowing.
“Take away his hands,” Anna’s voice says.
Seryozha, all in white, with his back and head bent, was standing at a table under a looking-glass, and with an expression of intense concentration which she knew well, and in which he resembled his father, he was doing something to the flowers he carried.
You know how irritable these sick people are.” Kitty, scowling more than ever, kept silent, and Varenka went on speaking alone, trying to soften or soothe her, and seeing a storm coming—she did not know whether of tears or of words.
At least not solely for that ... I’ve been made a _Kammerherr_; of course, one has to say thank you.
“That’s what I wanted to say to her,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, turning away.
The colonel of the regiment had announced that if these scandals did not cease he would have to leave.
“But there are the horses, too, they’re not good for much.” “We’ll get some more.
here he is!” he cried, bringing his big hand down heavily on his epaulet.
Never with any outside person, never on any official visit had he been so unnatural and false as he was that evening.
It was the gambler Myaskin, whom he knew, coming from the club.
How different it is at home!
The air was cold in the bright sun that filtered through the freshly washed leaves.
I ought to have....” But, before Alexey Alexandrovitch had time to finish his sentence, Stepan Arkadyevitch was behaving not at all as he had expected.
Why, there was scarcely a drop.
At last Vronsky, without waiting for the artist, walked away to another small picture.
Seeing her husband, she dropped her hands into the drawer of the bureau as though looking for something, and only looked round at him when he had come quite up to her.
“What was it?” inquired the princess.
If they’d told me at college that other people understood the integral calculus, and I didn’t, then pride would have come in.
Now when he heard that she was here, he was suddenly conscious of such delight, and at the same time of such dread, that his breath failed him and he could not utter what he wanted to say.
“But, Anna,” said Vronsky, in a soft and persuasive voice, trying to soothe her, “we absolutely must, anyway, tell him, and then be guided by the line he takes.” “What, run away?” “And why not run away?
“But with what object?” “To seem better to people, to myself, to God; to deceive everyone.
“But after all,” he asked himself before turning into the boudoir, “what has occurred?
“Won’t you get in, sir, we’ll make room this side!” she said to him.
Kitty and Levin would be of the party, and that this might not be obtrusively evident, there would be a girl cousin too, and young Shtcherbatsky, and _la pièce de resistance_ among the guests—Sergey Koznishev and Alexey Alexandrovitch.
Anna Pavlovna came up.
She had seen her husband.
Doctoring her seemed to her as absurd as putting together the pieces of a broken vase.
Now, perhaps, she doesn’t know on purpose,” said Betsy, with a subtle smile.
Take European history.
He saw that this association was a mere anchor to save him from self-contempt.
“Yes, please.” The parlor was a big room, with a Dutch stove, and a screen dividing it into two.
In his student days he had all but been in love with the eldest, Dolly, but she was soon married to Oblonsky.
“I am very, very glad to see you,” he went on.
A sketch had been made before, but he was dissatisfied with it.
And when he got out of the carriage at Bologova to get some seltzer water, and caught sight of Anna, involuntarily his first word had told her just what he thought.
What right had I to imagine she would care to join her life to mine?
At your service,” he said to his wife, sitting down.
She crimsoned, turned white, crimsoned again, and grew faint, waiting with quivering lips for him to come to her.
A hawk flew high over a forest far away with slow sweep of its wings; another flew with exactly the same motion in the same direction and vanished.
And the mowing to be all done by hired labor, not on half-profits.
Betsy reminded her that Liza Merkalova and Baroness Shtoltz were coming to play croquet with her that morning with their adorers, Kaluzhsky and old Stremov.
Two gentlemen with lighted cigarettes passed by her.
But the expression of her face, scared and gloomy, did not now promise even deception.
Since Alexey Alexandrovitch had left home with the intention of not returning to his family again, and since he had been at the lawyer’s and had spoken, though only to one man, of his intention, since especially he had translated the matter from the world of real life to the world of ink and paper, he had grown more and more used to his own intention, and by now distinctly perceived the feasibility of its execution.
“There’s a first-rate Tintoretto there.
“What’s that on the arm of the chair, a fur cloak or some beast?
Even the sequence of these images and emotions was the same.
What have I to be afraid of?
They were already making ready their handfuls of mud to fling at her when the right moment arrived.
“Of course, he’s not without talent, but it’s all in a wrong direction.
Larks trilled unseen above the velvety green fields and the ice-covered stubble-land; peewits wailed over the low lands and marshes flooded by the pools; cranes and wild geese flew high across the sky uttering their spring calls.
It was not yet two, when the large glass doors of the boardroom suddenly opened and someone came in.
What do I want?
That article’s too deep for many people—that’s to say it’s over their heads.
This glow shone out in her exquisite, truly enigmatic eyes.
“I shall be very glad to; I’ll go and put on my hat.
But his face was so piteous, that she restrained her vexation, and flinging some clothes off an armchair, she sat down beside him.
I want to look at her.” “Come along, then,” said the Englishman, frowning, and speaking with his mouth shut, and, with swinging elbows, he went on in front with his disjointed gait.
“Because I didn’t see the use of wasting my time over it.” “Oh, but excuse me, how did you know it would be wasting your time?
“I fancied something of the sort yesterday.
How can you believe....” But she would not let him interrupt her.
They enjoyed drinking out of the shallow cup of warm red wine and water, and they were still more pleased when the priest, flinging back his stole and taking both their hands in his, led them round the lectern to the accompaniment of bass voices chanting “Glory to God.” Shtcherbatsky and Tchirikov, supporting the crowns and stumbling over the bride’s train, smiling too and seeming delighted at something, were at one moment left behind, at the next treading on the bridal pair as the priest came to a halt.
There’s a big she-bear; one can go right up to the lair.
But that’s not the point,” and he turned again to the general with whom he was talking seriously; “we mustn’t forget that those who are taking part in the race are military men, who have chosen that career, and one must allow that every calling has its disagreeable side.
Why, what is it?
He walked back, went into his room again, and asked for coffee.
Yashvin overtook him with his cap, and led him home, and half an hour later Vronsky had regained his self-possession.
“I have the honor of knowing your brother, Sergey Ivanovitch,” said Grinevitch, holding out his slender hand with its long nails.
Levin heard the words, and they impressed him.
Come, tell me.... Stop a minute, let’s sit down,” said Kitty, making her sit down again beside her.
Well, then what of it?
God is merciful ... thanks....” he said, not knowing what he was saying, as he responded to the tearful kiss of the princess that he felt on his hand.
Vronsky, Anna, and Golenishtchev, on their way home, were particularly lively and cheerful.
After the women came the men with pitchforks, and from the gray rows there were growing up broad, high, soft haycocks.
He was, as it were, stripping off the wrappings which hindered it from being distinctly seen.
Kitty wrote that no prospect was so alluring as to spend the summer with Dolly at Ergushovo, full of childish associations for both of them.
“What’s the matter with you?” Shtcherbatsky asked him.
On his invitation, the two elder ones at once jumped out to him and ran with him as simply as they would have done with their nurse or Miss Hoole or their mother.
“Thank you, very good,” she answered.
She both feared his speaking and wished for it.
“Not bad,” he repeated, turning his dewy, brilliant eyes from Levin to the Tatar.
It’s a matter of ten roubles,” he added, relaxing his lips into a smile.
Except for the slight quiver of her lips and the moisture in her eyes that made them brighter, her smile was almost calm as she said: “How long it is since we’ve seen each other!” and with desperate determination she pressed his hand with her cold hand.
He flew down, and without even changing the position of his hands, skated away over the ice.
He knew that would be an act of vengeance on his part, and that he did not want.
Her eyes were particularly bright, and were continually swimming with tears.
But that’s just why I’m afraid to speak—because I’m happy now, happy in hope, anyway.... And then?...
But Levin’s words did not, it seemed, make much impression on the priest.
One of the chief difficulties was that the process of cultivating the land was in full swing, that it was impossible to stop everything and begin it all again from the beginning, and the machine had to be mended while in motion.
Folding the letter and smoothing it with a massive ivory knife, and putting it in an envelope with the money, he rang the bell with the gratification it always afforded him to use the well arranged appointments of his writing-table.
Bending her curly black head, she pressed her forehead against a cool watering pot that stood on the parapet, and both her lovely hands, with the rings he knew so well, clasped the pot.
When she had got round the turn, she gave herself a push off with one foot, and skated straight up to Shtcherbatsky.
She dared not show him her sense of her own insignificance beside him.
But this interview was still of the utmost gravity for her.
He was only looking at the book to avoid conversation with the officers coming in and out; he was thinking.
“That gentleman must be a man of great energy,” said Grinevitch, when Levin had gone away.
“And do you suppose she understands nothing?” said Nikolay.
But listen: we’re the same age, you’ve known a greater number of women perhaps than I have.” Serpohovskoy’s smile and gestures told Vronsky that he mustn’t be afraid, that he would be tender and careful in touching the sore place.
Darya Alexandrovna Oblonskaya had invited him, when he was over there, to come; to come with the object of renewing his offer to her sister, who would, so she gave him to understand, accept him now.
It was past one o’clock.
“Why ever shouldn’t you manage it?” “We positively must have another fifteen laborers.
That’s just what Anna Arkadyevna has just said.” “I should be very glad if I had said it, for it’s not only clever but true,” said Anna, smiling.
Alexey Alexandrovitch halted in the middle of the room.
Only when he stood by her head, she was suddenly quieter, while the muscles quivered under her soft, delicate coat.
Chapter 19 “Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.” So Levin thought about his wife as he talked to her that evening.
He’s persecuted by the police, of course, because he’s not a scoundrel.” And he looked round in the way he always did at everyone in the room.
“Here we live, and know nothing of what’s going on,” Vronsky said to Golenishtchev as he came to see him one morning.
And going back into the drawing-room, they stood in a corner.
He could not even think of the problem of death itself, but with no will of his own thoughts kept coming to him of what he had to do next; closing the dead man’s eyes, dressing him, ordering the coffin.
“It’s too violent a transition,” he said, “to go from such company to old Madame Vrede.
She looked round for someone to give her fan to, and their hostess, smiling to her, took it.
“I’ll put them on directly,” he said.
“You don’t know!
“I’m a wicked woman, a lost woman,” she thought; “but I don’t like lying, I can’t endure falsehood, while as for _him_ (her husband) it’s the breath of his life—falsehood.
“Come, I’ll do it all, if you like....” “Yes, they must be reconciled,” thought Anna.
I am very unhappy.” He had no need to say that.
Her face looked weary, and there was not that play of eagerness in it, peeping out in her smile and her eyes; but for a single instant, as she glanced at him, there was a flash of something in her eyes, and although the flash died away at once, he was happy for that moment.
“We have succeeded in getting the information from the government department of Penza.
She had by now got her household matters so satisfactorily arranged, thanks to Marya Philimonovna, that she was disinclined to make any change in them; besides, she had no faith in Levin’s knowledge of farming.
But her brother did not hear her.
He vaguely felt that there was something in it insulting to him, and he was not angry now at what had disturbed him, but he fell foul of everything that presented itself.
Images, memories, and ideas of the strangest description followed one another with extraordinary rapidity and vividness.
This was not as it should be, but with the laborers Levin seldom lost his temper.
Vronsky gazed, never taking his eyes from her, and smiled, he could not have said why.
“But how did she go through it?
“What does it mean?
“I think you are partly right.
The hurdles, as he ascertained, being not wanted in winter, had been carried to the cart-horses’ stable; and there broken, as they were of light construction, only meant for feeding calves.
“It was ever so nice of you to come.” Alexey Alexandrovitch kissed her hand.
“I’ve always been hearing about you through my wife,” said Serpuhovskoy.
If Levin had been alone now with his brother Nikolay, he would have looked at him with terror, and with still greater terror waited, and would not have known what else to do.
Don’t thank me.
taken a stray swarm, Fomitch?” he asked.
It is true that Fyodor Ryezunov’s company did not plough over the ground twice before sowing, as had been agreed, justifying themselves on the plea that the time was too short.
“What am I to write to him?” said Levin.
Anna was even more friendly to him than to other people, and was very grateful for her portrait.
‘_Erlaucht, Durchlaucht?_’ Directly they say ‘_Durchlaucht_,’ I can’t hold out.
He particularly liked the program of that day’s dinner.
Serpuhovskoy had planned his appointment at Tashkend, and Vronsky agreed to the proposition without the slightest hesitation.
Koznishev admitted both points, but with limitations.
Be that as it might, when, on the seventh day, he parted from the prince, who was starting for Moscow, and received his thanks, he was happy to be rid of his uncomfortable position and the unpleasant reflection of himself.
Chapter 7 On arriving in Moscow by a morning train, Levin had put up at the house of his elder half-brother, Koznishev.
Everyone has enough to bear in his own grief!” And regaining his self-possession, Alexey Alexandrovitch quietly took leave and went away.
Moreover, in the event of divorce, or even of an attempt to obtain a divorce, it was obvious that the wife broke off all relations with the husband and threw in her lot with the lover.
She knew, too, that in spite of his official duties, which swallowed up almost the whole of his time, he considered it his duty to keep up with everything of note that appeared in the intellectual world.
What’s to be done—you tell me that, what’s to be done?
Well, then, there’s nothing left but to pray to God.
Aliosha, it is true, did not stand quite correctly; he kept turning round, trying to look at his little jacket from behind; but all the same he was wonderfully sweet.
To forget!” he said to himself with the serene confidence of a healthy man that if he is tired and sleepy, he will go to sleep at once.
He disliked contradiction, and still more, arguments that were continually skipping from one thing to another, introducing new and disconnected points, so that there was no knowing to which to reply.
“This morning Liza came to see me—they’re not afraid to call on me, in spite of the Countess Lidia Ivanovna,” she put in—“and she told me about your Athenian evening.
The tone in which her husband had said the last words wounded her, especially because he evidently did not believe what she had said.
She is up,” answered the girl.
oysters.” Stepan Arkadyevitch became thoughtful.
“No honor, no heart, no religion; a corrupt woman.
“So much the better,” thought Vronsky, when he received the news.
The adjutant-general expressed his disapproval of races.
And there’s nothing left for me but....” She would have said death, but Stepan Arkadyevitch would not let her finish.
Her success in society had been greater than that of either of her elder sisters, and greater even than her mother had anticipated.
Stremov joined in her entreaties.
“Not at all,” he said.
“There, how do you manage never to be bored by things?
Oh, wait a minute, though,” he said, still holding her and stroking her soft little hand.
Levin led his friend to the room set apart for visitors, where Stepan Arkadyevitch’s things were carried also—a bag, a gun in a case, a satchel for cigars.
“Is not a divorce possible?” he said feebly.
And this knowledge poisoned the pleasure he had hoped to find in the visit to Sviazhsky.
“No, I’m not dull, I am very busy,” he said, feeling that she was holding him in check by her composed tone, which he would not have the force to break through, just as it had been at the beginning of the winter.
But remembering the muzzle, she shook it and again began restlessly stamping one after the other her shapely legs.
How delighted I should have been to see that crowd under the windows!
“We’ll admit, princess, that that’s not superficial,” he said, “but internal.
“Yes, yes, to be sure; it does waste a lot of time,” the doctor responded vaguely to some reply of Sludin’s he had not caught.
“I sent to Alexey to find out how he is, and he writes me he is quite well and unhurt, but in despair.” “So _he_ will be here,” she thought.
In the very heat of the day the mowing did not seem such hard work to him.
The gray-whiskered landowner smiled at the mention of the profits of Sviazhsky’s famling, obviously aware how much gain his neighbor and marshal was likely to be making.
And the bridal pair tried several times to understand what they had to do, and each time made some mistake and were corrected by the priest in a whisper.
What is to be, will be!
But in spite of this, while he was turning over his studies, pulling up the blinds and taking off the sheet, he was in intense excitement, especially as, in spite of his conviction that all distinguished and wealthy Russians were certain to be beasts and fools, he liked Vronsky, and still more Anna.
“I understand it all.
Levin thought of the text, not because he considered himself “wise and prudent.” He did not so consider himself, but he could not help knowing that he had more intellect than his wife and Agafea Mihalovna, and he could not help knowing that when he thought of death, he thought with all the force of his intellect.
Her husband, about whom everything was well known beforehand, had come, looked at his future bride, and been looked at.
He begged pardon, and was getting into the carriage, but felt he must glance at her once more; not that she was very beautiful, not on account of the elegance and modest grace which were apparent in her whole figure, but because in the expression of her charming face, as she passed close by him, there was something peculiarly caressing and soft.
They went into the little yard in front of the shed.
We see the Rhine provinces have been turned French, but the Germans are not at a lower stage!” he shouted.
And me to go magnanimously to forgive her, and have pity on her!
She brought her clothes and a note.
The greater number of the middle-aged people and certain great personages were displeased at the prospect of the impending scandal in society.
But I must!
But one thing is possible, one thing she might desire,” he went on, “that is the cessation of your relations and all memories associated with them.
He shook hands with him, and together they ascended the steps.
The crowd who had left the train were running back again.
For such work us fellows would catch it!” The grass became softer, and Levin, listening without answering, followed Tit, trying to do the best he could.
I want to see him.” Alexey Alexandrovitch took Vronsky’s hands and drew them away from his face, which was awful with the expression of agony and shame upon it.
Eh?” “It’s all the same to me.
If I don’t know, it’s my fault; either I’m stupid or a naughty boy,” thought the child.
“One goes for a walk, one looks in a shop, and they ask you to buy.
“Why, you saved that Levin from disagreeable consequences.” “Yes, _sa compagne_ called me, and I tried to pacify him, he’s very ill, and was dissatisfied with the doctor.
The priest turned to Levin saying something.
pardon!_ Waltz!
The mare’s excitement had infected Vronsky.
He would have to pay some two thousand roubles on these debts too, in order to be quite free from anxiety.
Oh, Semyon the contractor came the day after you left.
He had bachelor tastes, and it was in accordance with them that he shaped his life.
“Alexey Alexandrovitch, forgive me, I have no right ... but I love Anna as a sister, and esteem her; I beg, I beseech you to tell me what is wrong between you?
This slight, as it were, rebounded upon him.
The last class of debts—to shops, to hotels, to his tailor—were such as need not be considered.
“You’ve long been expected, prince.” “What did you send word to the princess that we weren’t going for?” the artist whispered hoarsely once more, still more angrily, obviously exasperated that his voice failed him so that he could not give his words the expression he would have liked to.
But time and work did their part.
“According to that, if my senses are annihilated, if my body is dead, I can have no existence of any sort?” he queried.
In the middle of the winter Vronsky spent a very tiresome week.
I’ve made a mess of my life.
I don’t want anything.
“Varenka, forgive me, do forgive me,” whispered Kitty, going up to her.
At his usual time he got up and made his toilet for the night.
You are one of those delightful women in whose company it’s sweet to be silent as well as to talk.
He simply gave Alexey Alexandrovitch the money he needed together with a brief statement of the position of his affairs, which was not altogether satisfactory, as it had happened that during that year, owing to increased expenses, more had been paid out than usual, and there was a deficit.
“The horses can be taken out and I will see no one,” he said in answer to the porter, with a certain pleasure, indicative of his agreeable frame of mind, emphasizing the words, “see no one.” In his study Alexey Alexandrovitch walked up and down twice, and stopped at an immense writing-table, on which six candles had already been lighted by the valet who had preceded him.
He found fault with the doctor, regretting he had not a celebrated Moscow doctor.
Stepan Arkadyevitch’s eyes sparkled merrily.
“Your brother left a letter and a note for you.
Where is he?
what have I done?
who made all that enchants me in this world—the earth, the waters, the sun, the flowers, the grass?’ Can you say to him: ‘I don’t know’?
“How do you feel?” she asked him.
To my thinking, in your position what’s essential is the formation of a new attitude to one another.
I am going away at once, and you may live here with your mistress!” And she went out, slamming the door.
After all’s said and done, we’re not strangers.
Quite well?
Levin led him into his study.
There was nothing.
He felt that his heart was throbbing, and that he, too, like the mare, longed to move, to bite; it was both dreadful and delicious.
Kitty was silent for a few seconds, looking timidly and ruefully at her husband; then she went up and took him by the elbow with both hands.
But what’s the use of talking?
“I told them to come on Sunday, and till then not to trouble you or themselves for nothing,” he said.
“Oh, Agafea Mihalovna,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, kissing the tips of his plump fingers, “what salt goose, what herb brandy!...
“He has great talent,” said Anna with a delighted smile.
But it appeared that the carpenter was repairing the harrows, which ought to have been repaired before Lent.
“_Entendons nous...._” But in her eyes there were gleams of light that betrayed that she understood perfectly and precisely as he did what hope he might have.
Among the brides that came back to her memory, she thought too of her darling Anna, of whose proposed divorce she had just been hearing.
Before you’ve time to get your hat on, I’ll be back.” And he ran downstairs, clattering with his heels like a spring-rattle.
“Do this for my sake,” the Countess Lidia Ivanovna had said to him.
After looking round the parlor, Levin went out in the back yard.
The more attentively Kitty watched her unknown friend, the more convinced she was this girl was the perfect creature she fancied her, and the more eagerly she wished to make her acquaintance.
