Mihail Vassilievitch promptly went out on the terrace .
&quot; Yes , you are angry .
Dolly could not help sighing .
Or was it a dream ?
&quot; What biceps !
&quot; I hear a very interesting conversation , &quot; he added , and walked to the other end of the table , where Sviazhsky was sitting with the two gentlemen of the neighborhood .
&quot; Well , well ! &quot; Kitty urged impatiently , looking darkly at Varenka .
&quot; We mowed the whole meadow !
&quot; And as I go on , I love her more and more .
This new life could not but have terrors for her inexperience ; but , terrible or not , the change had been wrought six weeks before in her soul , and this was merely the final sanction of what had long been completed in her heart .
&quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch , do uncover his face !
Every time Levin tried to penetrate beyond the outer chambers of Sviazhsky &apos;s mind , which were hospitably open to all , he noticed that Sviazhsky was slightly disconcerted ; faint signs of alarm were visible in his eyes , as though he were afraid Levin would understand him , and he would give him a kindly , good @-@ humored repulse .
&quot; They &apos;re getting cold , &quot; she whispered .
Directing the coachman to a place under the shed in the big , clean , tidy yard , with charred , old @-@ fashioned ploughs in it , the old man asked Levin to come into the parlor .
As he looked round , she too turned her head .
Nothing , nothing , silence , &quot; said Levin , and muffling him once more in his fur coat , he added : &quot; I do like you so !
After trying various subjects of conversation , she got him upon painting , of which he talked very well , and she listened to him attentively .
&quot; No , &quot; answered Varenka with a smile , laying her hand on the music , &quot; no , let &apos;s have that one . &quot; And she sang it just as quietly , as coolly , and as well as the others .
But I &apos;m glad you &apos;re in good spirits , and are hunting bears , and working , and interested .
Yes , and so imperceptibly too my views of life changed ! &quot; He went out of the meadow and walked along the highroad towards the village .
&quot; This is my daughter , &quot; said the prince .
&quot; People cannot go on living together - here you have a fact .
&quot; When I was beginning to despair , and it seemed there would be no end - it &apos;s come !
This stiffness hurt Kitty , and she could not resist the desire to smooth over her mother &apos;s coldness .
Wait a bit , I &apos;ll remember ! &quot; Petritsky went behind the partition and lay down on his bed .
If I had any pride , I should not have put myself in such a position . &quot; And he pictured to himself Vronsky , happy , good @-@ natured , clever , and self @-@ possessed , certainly never placed in the awful position in which he had been that evening .
We sold about eight bushels and sowed a rood . &quot; &quot; Well , mind you crumble up the clods , &quot; said Levin , going towards his horse , &quot; and keep an eye on Mishka .
She blushed when Vronsky brought in Golenishtchev , and he was extremely charmed by this childish blush overspreading her candid and handsome face .
He was carefully finishing the figure when the cards were brought him .
And when &apos;s the wedding to be ?
He felt that everyone was looking at him with inquiring wonder , that he was not understood , and that something was expected of him .
I expect you &apos;re as hungry as a wolf .
&quot; It &apos;s wonderful what expression there is in her hand , &quot; he thought , remembering how they had been sitting the day before at a corner table .
&quot; I must rest a little before my journey . &quot; &quot; Are you certainly going tomorrow then ? &quot; asked Vronsky .
Instinct had not misled Stepan Arkadyevitch .
&quot; That doesn &apos;t interest you ? &quot; &quot; On the contrary , it does , very much .
&quot; Oh , I &apos;m so glad ! &quot; answered Betsy , at once understanding that he was speaking of Anna .
Yes , yes ; I think a little dirty man with a disheveled beard was stooping down doing something , and all of a sudden he began saying some strange words in French .
That day Varenka came to dinner and told them that Anna Pavlovna had changed her mind and given up the expedition for the morrow .
I know they say men tell their wives of their former lives , but Stiva &quot; - she corrected herself - &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch told me nothing .
&quot; You &apos;ve come , that &apos;s the chief thing .
&quot; It &apos;s not right to go on like this , &quot; he thought .
Am I going out of my mind ? &quot; he said to himself .
The old servant to whose hut he had gone to get dry evidently approved of Levin &apos;s plan , and of his own accord proposed to enter the partnership by the purchase of cattle .
He heard only her words and gave them only the direct sense they bore .
He was pleased to think that , even in such an important crisis in life , no one would be able to say that he had not acted in accordance with the principles of that religion whose banner he had always held aloft amid the general coolness and indifference .
It seemed to Levin that they knew all about it already and sympathized with him , saying nothing merely from delicacy .
He &apos;s the son , it appears , of some Moscow butler , and has never had any sort of bringing @-@ up .
It &apos;s good for me , and good for her . &quot; And he began wondering where to finish the evening .
Dolly , dearest , I do understand , &quot; said Anna , pressing her hand .
&quot; Do let us try at once , countess , &quot; he said ; but Levin would finish saying what he thought .
The doctor confirmed his suppositions in regard to Kitty .
It has made things better , ever so much better . &quot; Chapter 20 The whole of that day Anna spent at home , that &apos;s to say at the Oblonskys , &quot; and received no one , though some of her acquaintances had already heard of her arrival , and came to call the same day .
But come after the opera . &quot; Vronsky looked inquiringly at her .
&quot; Put it on ! &quot; she whispered , smiling .
&quot; I am going to Seryozha .
Having learned all these facts , the princess found nothing to object to in her daughter &apos;s intimacy with Varenka , more especially as Varenka &apos;s breeding and education were of the best - she spoke French and English extremely well - and what was of the most weight , brought a message from Madame Stahl expressing her regret that she was prevented by her ill health from making the acquaintance of the princess .
His brother raised money for him , the princess advised him to leave Moscow after the wedding .
Let &apos;s stay a little .
All the world knows him . &quot; &quot; I know him by reputation and by sight .
Petritsky was asleep when Vronsky and Yashvin came into the hut .
And so you , I hear ... _ vous filez le parfait amour .
The little piece left uncut in the corner was mown in five minutes .
Alexey Alexandrovitch grew up an orphan .
&quot; Tchk !
Did it often happen ?
was it impossible , if the money were properly laid out , to provide medical aid ? &quot; &quot; Impossible , as it seems to me .... For the three thousand square miles of our district , what with our thaws , and the storms , and the work in the fields , I don &apos;t see how it is possible to provide medical aid all over .
&quot; Come , tell me how things are going with you , &quot; said Levin , bethinking himself that it was not nice of him to think only of himself .
&quot; Quiet , darling , quiet ! &quot; he said , patting her again over her hind @-@ quarters ; and with a glad sense that his mare was in the best possible condition , he went out of the horse @-@ box .
That &apos;s not much , I think .
You &apos;re perfection .
what a delightful meeting ! &quot; he began .
He was angry with all of them for their interference just because he felt in his soul that they , all these people , were right .
&quot; Splendid !
For the first instant Vronsky was not master either of himself or his mare .
&quot; They - they &apos;re a nice lot ! &quot; &quot; That &apos;s so , &quot; responded the clerk , handing him the reins and buttoning the leather apron .
It seemed to Levin that the priest and the deacon too wanted to smile just as he did .
But the expression was so true that he , and others too , fancied they had long known it .
) , I must look at his face ; will he feel I &apos;m looking at him ?
A footman brought in a thick packet directed in Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s hand .
&quot; It means _ never _ , &quot; she said ; &quot; but that &apos;s not true ! &quot; He quickly rubbed out what he had written , gave her the chalk , and stood up .
What delighted him particularly was that now he knew he would be able to hold out .
How nice it all was !
He could recognize in no one but himself an indubitable right to love her .
That meant something .
&quot; So here you are , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , giving him his hand .
Impossible to get women to scrub the floors - all were potato @-@ hoeing .
The professor , in annoyance , and , as it were , mental suffering at the interruption , looked round at the strange inquirer , more like a bargeman than a philosopher , and turned his eyes upon Sergey Ivanovitch , as though to ask : What &apos;s one to say to him ?
Levin felt that it was unpardonable to eat , to sleep , to talk even now , and it seemed to him that every movement he made was unseemly .
He now dogged her footsteps , like Vaska .
&quot; But do drink something .
&quot; But I will tell you it from the beginning .
&quot; I am afraid you are not quite comfortable here , &quot; she said , turning away from his fixed stare , and looking about the room .
Levin did not remember his own mother , and his only sister was older than he was , so that it was in the Shtcherbatskys &quot; house that he saw for the first time that inner life of an old , noble , cultivated , and honorable family of which he had been deprived by the death of his father and mother .
Levin went to his brother &apos;s room .
&quot; Tell me , isn &apos;t it humiliating to think that a man has disdained your love , that he hasn &apos;t cared for it ? ... &quot; &quot; But he didn &apos;t disdain it ; I believe he cared for me , but he was a dutiful son .... &quot; &quot; Yes , but if it hadn &apos;t been on account of his mother , if it had been his own doing ? ... &quot; said Kitty , feeling she was giving away her secret , and that her face , burning with the flush of shame , had betrayed her already .
&quot; I told you I did not know whether I should be here long ... that it depended on you .... &quot; She dropped her head lower and lower , not knowing herself what answer she should make to what was coming .
But he saw clearly now ( his work on a book of agriculture , in which the chief element in husbandry was to have been the laborer , greatly assisted him in this ) that the sort of farming he was carrying on was nothing but a cruel and stubborn struggle between him and the laborers , in which there was on one side - his side - a continual intense effort to change everything to a pattern he considered better ; on the other side , the natural order of things .
Anna Arkadyevna did not stay to supper , but went home .
&quot; That is ... how does he drink ? &quot; &quot; Drinks vodka , and it &apos;s bad for him . &quot; &quot; And a great deal ? &quot; whispered Levin .
It depends upon you , &quot; he said , and was immediately horror @-@ stricken at his own words .
Chapter 32 The particulars which the princess had learned in regard to Varenka &apos;s past and her relations with Madame Stahl were as follows : Madame Stahl , of whom some people said that she had worried her husband out of his life , while others said it was he who had made her wretched by his immoral behavior , had always been a woman of weak health and enthusiastic temperament .
He was not put out of temper even by the sight of the peasants &quot; horses and colts trampling down his young grass ( he told a peasant he met to drive them out ) , nor by the sarcastic and stupid reply of the peasant Ipat , whom he met on the way , and asked , &quot; Well , Ipat , shall we soon be sowing ? &quot; &quot; We must get the ploughing done first , Konstantin Dmitrievitch , &quot; answered Ipat .
On the Sunday in St. Peter &apos;s week Darya Alexandrovna drove to mass for all her children to take the sacrament .
No one but she herself understood her position ; no one knew that she had just refused the man whom perhaps she loved , and refused him because she had put her faith in another .
&quot; So much the worse for those who keep up the fashion .
As in former years , at the beginning of the spring he had gone to a foreign watering @-@ place for the sake of his health , deranged by the winter &apos;s work that every year grew heavier .
&quot; I &apos;m not looking , I &apos;m not looking ! &quot; she said , putting the arm in .
&quot; And I am very grateful for your decision .
Nothing keeps them in order but their own communal court and their village elder .
But life like that was impossible , and so Konstantin tried to do what he had been trying to do all his life , and never could learn to do , though , as far as he could observe , many people knew so well how to do it , and without it there was no living at all .
&quot; How silly men are , though , in this position , &quot; he said to Tchirikov , when Levin , after looking absently at him , had moved back to his bride .
Chapter 12 In the early days after his return from Moscow , whenever Levin shuddered and grew red , remembering the disgrace of his rejection , he said to himself : &quot; This was just how I used to shudder and blush , thinking myself utterly lost , when I was plucked in physics and did not get my remove ; and how I thought myself utterly ruined after I had mismanaged that affair of my sister &apos;s that was entrusted to me .
She seemed only to be asking : &quot; Am I to sing again , or is that enough ? &quot; &quot; If it had been I , &quot; thought Kitty , &quot; how proud I should have been !
&quot; Yesterday at the races all I wanted was to get to you , but you &apos;d gone away .
&quot; Ever since I heard about you , about your refusal , I began .... Of course , I approved of what you did .
what for ? &quot; he went on , as angrily .
The fair one darts upstairs to the top story .
His kindly smile was so winning that Alexey Alexandrovitch , feeling his own weakness and unconsciously swayed by it , was ready to believe what Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying .
And besides , hard though it was for the mother to bear the dread of illness , the illnesses themselves , and the grief of seeing signs of evil propensities in her children - the children themselves were even now repaying her in small joys for her sufferings .
Eight straight away , and the rest in six years .
On the other side her husband &apos;s unhappiness had given her too much happiness to be regretted .
Alexey Alexandrovitch too was silent , and everyone stood up and turned towards the stream .
The muscles stood up sharply under the network of sinews , covered with the delicate , mobile skin , soft as satin , and they were hard as bone .
&quot; Ah , Kostya ! &quot; he exclaimed suddenly , recognizing his brother , and his eyes lit up with joy .
They feel that this is something different , that this is not a mere pastime , that this woman is dearer to me than life .
You want a man &apos;s work , too , always to have a defined aim , and love and family life always to be undivided - and that &apos;s not how it is .
&quot; Everything is clear and good in your heart . &quot; &quot; Every heart has its own _ skeletons _ , as the English say . &quot; &quot; You have no sort of _ skeleton _ , have you ?
He kissed her hand , kissed her hair , kissed her hand again - still she was silent .
He was speaking of some enterprise .
In the porch of the hut he was met by two officers ; one of his regiment and one of another .
I know everything . &quot; &quot; No , you may say what you like , prince , there &apos;s the interest of their institutions , &quot; said the colonel .
&quot; You &apos;re not afraid of getting fat ? &quot; &quot; Waiter , sherry ! &quot; said Vronsky , without replying , and moving the book to the other side of him , he went on reading .
No , really , I envy you .
The earth in the cart , with which the seed was mixed , was not crushed to powder , but crusted together or adhering in clods .
What touched me most .... &quot; ( and here Anna guessed what would touch Dolly most ) &quot; he &apos;s tortured by two things : that he &apos;s ashamed for the children &apos;s sake , and that , loving you - yes , yes , loving you beyond everything on earth , &quot; she hurriedly interrupted Dolly , who would have answered - &quot; he has hurt you , pierced you to the heart .
But he felt all the difficulty of his position and was sorry for his wife , his children , and himself .
&quot; How glad I am you &apos;ve come ! &quot; said Betsy .
&quot; Still he &apos;s not worth her little finger , is he ? &quot; &quot; Oh , I like him so - not because he &apos;s my future _ beau @-@ frère _ , &quot; answered Madame Lvova .
&quot; Don &apos;t be in a hurry , &quot; said Cord to Vronsky , &quot; and remember one thing : don &apos;t hold her in at the fences , and don &apos;t urge her on ; let her go as she likes . &quot; &quot; All right , all right , &quot; said Vronsky , taking the reins .
But you know that &apos;s not ... _ not in my line , _ &quot; said Vronsky in English .
Jealousy according to his notions was an insult to one &apos;s wife , and one ought to have confidence in one &apos;s wife .
When they rose from the table and the ladies had gone out , Pestsov did not follow them , but addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch , began to expound the chief ground of inequality .
She glanced at him seriously , then leaned her puckered brow on her hands and began to read .
This rapid drive calmed him .
He walked after Sappho into the drawing @-@ room , and followed her about as though he were chained to her , keeping his sparkling eyes fixed on her as though he wanted to eat her .
The only thing I know is that you always do what no one else does . &quot; &quot; Yes , &quot; said Levin , slowly and with emotion , &quot; you &apos;re right .
The irrigation of these lands in the Zaraisky province had been initiated by the predecessor of Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s predecessor .
... &quot;
In February he had received a letter from Marya Nikolaevna telling him that his brother Nikolay &apos;s health was getting worse , but that he would not take advice , and in consequence of this letter Levin went to Moscow to his brother &apos;s and succeeded in persuading him to see a doctor and to go to a watering @-@ place abroad .
But has he broken it off with her ? &quot; she thought .
Where is the letter ? &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;ve forgotten really .
&quot; Go along , make haste , &quot; he added smiling , and gathering up his books , he prepared to go too .
He was not tall , though as broadly built as Alexey , and handsomer and rosier than he ; he had a red nose , and an open , drunken @-@ looking face .
There was the same conception of the senselessness of everything to come in life , the same consciousness of humiliation .
Kitty did not insist .
She did not want to talk of her sorrow , but with that sorrow in her heart she could not talk of outside matters .
There was only anticipation , the dread and joy of the new and the unknown .
Life had to be got through somehow till death did come .
I &apos;m not going to let you go for anything , &quot; answered Betsy , looking intently into Anna &apos;s face .
But he had no words to express this desire of deliverance , and so he did not speak of it , and from habit asked for the satisfaction of desires which could not now be satisfied .
In spite of the excited condition in which he was , the sentence about technique had sent a pang to Mihailov &apos;s heart , and looking angrily at Vronsky he suddenly scowled .
All her life , all her desires and hopes were concentrated on this one man , still uncomprehended by her , to whom she was bound by a feeling of alternate attraction and repulsion , even less comprehended than the man himself , and all the while she was going on living in the outward conditions of her old life .
When he saw that his expectations were realized , that there was nothing to prevent him from speaking , his face became gloomy .
Marya Yevgenyevna and her daughter expressed their thanks and admiration .
The picture of his wife not letting him go was so pleasant that he was ready to renounce the delights of looking upon bears forever .
&quot; What was it ?
&quot; I know she really cares for me . &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed and said nothing .
That &apos;s the question of an _ enfant terrible _ , &quot; and Betsy obviously tried to restrain herself , but could not , and went off into peals of that infectious laughter that people laugh who do not laugh often .
Her name , written in blue pencil , &quot; Anna , &quot; was the first thing that caught his eye .
&quot; Let us send for my brother , &quot; she said ; &quot; he can get a dinner anyway , or we shall have the children getting nothing to eat till six again , like yesterday . &quot; &quot; Very well , I will come directly and see about it .
Betsy had said to Anna that she had adopted the pose of an innocent child , but when Anna saw her , she felt that this was not the truth .
But it is hard for anyone who is dissatisfied not to blame someone else , and especially the person nearest of all to him , for the ground of his dissatisfaction .
The princess gave us a sketch of Alexey Alexandrovitch , &quot; said the ambassador &apos;s wife with a smile , as she sat down at the table .
And besides , I don &apos;t believe in medicine . &quot; &quot; Oh , well , that &apos;s unfair ...
It had always happened before that Miss Hoole found them and pointed them out to her ; but this time she found a big one quite of herself , and there was a general scream of delight , &quot; Lily has found a mushroom ! &quot; Then they reached the river , put the horses under the birch trees , and went to the bathing @-@ place .
They were carrying something , and dropped it .
But in spite of this caution , Vronsky often saw the child &apos;s intent , bewildered glance fixed upon him , and a strange shyness , uncertainty , at one time friendliness , at another , coldness and reserve , in the boy &apos;s manner to him ; as though the child felt that between this man and his mother there existed some important bond , the significance of which he could not understand .
&quot; Yes , especially as I can &apos;t stay very long with you .
&quot; Well , what do you say ?
He felt that men would crush him as dogs strangle a torn dog yelping with pain .
&quot; I often think men have no understanding of what &apos;s not honorable though they &apos;re always talking of it , &quot; said Anna , without answering him .
But immediately , while rapidly greeting her acquaintances , and shaking the hands proffered to her , she addressed Princess Betsy : &quot; I have been at Countess Lidia &apos;s , and meant to have come here earlier , but I stayed on .
&quot; It &apos;s a new manner , &quot; she said .
I ignore it .
&quot; That &apos;s the best way , &quot; Stremov put in .
Her voice was lively , eager , with exceedingly distinct intonations .
Both knew , without a shade of doubt , what sort of thing life was and what was death , and though neither of them could have answered , and would even not have understood the questions that presented themselves to Levin , both had no doubt of the significance of this event , and were precisely alike in their way of looking at it , which they shared with millions of people .
&quot; Here , your Highness , &quot; says he , &quot; is the new helmet . &quot; She turned the helmet the other side up , And - just picture it ! - plop went a pear and sweetmeats out of it , two pounds of sweetmeats ! ...
&quot; Perhaps they know us ! &quot; and he hurriedly turned off , drawing her after him into a side path .
Levin tried to understand him , and could not understand him , and looked at him and his life as at a living enigma .
Called him out and shot him ! &quot; &quot; Ah ! &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch indifferently , and lifting his eyebrows , he went into the drawing @-@ room .
He sowed wheat .
All the variety , all the charm , all the beauty of life is made up of light and shadow . &quot; Levin sighed and made no reply .
They arrived at the meeting .
Vronsky was himself the same , and regarded it as a great merit to be so .
And he felt depressed .
Moreover , he felt certain that Yashvin , as it was , took no delight in gossip and scandal , and interpreted his feeling rightly , that is to say , knew and believed that this passion was not a jest , not a pastime , but something more serious and important .
&quot; What &apos;s the use of being dreary ? &quot; said Agafea Mihalovna .
&quot; You &apos;re all in good spirits .
&quot; No , it &apos;s not the admiration of the crowd has intoxicated her , but the adoration of one .
&quot; You can conjecture what awaits you and your son .... &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a threat to take away my child , and most likely by their stupid law he can .
He had a feeling that any smile would jar on them .
Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys &quot; house .
&quot; I am an outsider , but I so love her and respect you that I venture to advise .
&quot; He &apos;s not well , and I fancy .... Well , what do you think of him ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you , &quot; said the doctor , beckoning over Sludin &apos;s head to his coachman to bring the carriage round .
She is oppressed , humiliated by the consciousness of her disabilities . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m oppressed and humiliated that they won &apos;t engage me at the Foundling , &quot; the old prince said again , to the huge delight of Turovtsin , who in his mirth dropped his asparagus with the thick end in the sauce .
What is there in her ?
Yes , we must put an end to it , &quot; he decided .
He made a joke or two , and talked just as much as was consistent with due decorum , and began work .
And yet Levin could never get this done .
&quot; What weather for haying !
But later on the princess noticed that , apart from this adoration , some kind of serious spiritual change was taking place in her daughter .
The peasant women even made Darya Alexandrovna laugh , and offended the English governess , because she was the cause of the laughter she did not understand .
In reality , of all the Russian entertainments the prince liked best French actresses and ballet dancers and white @-@ seal champagne .
A duel is quite irrational , and no one expects it of me .
When he had finished , Vronsky sat down by Serpuhovskoy .
&quot; Alone .
Besides this , she realized that if even here in her own house she could hardly manage to look after her five children properly , they would be still worse off where she was going with them all .
And every time he had stumbled against life itself he had shrunk away from it .
The choice has been made , and so much the better .... And there can be no repeating it . &quot; &quot; Ah , pride , pride ! &quot; said Darya Alexandrovna , as though despising him for the baseness of this feeling in comparison with that other feeling which only women know .
&quot; I met Vronsky at the railway station . &quot; &quot; Oh , was he there ? &quot; asked Kitty , blushing .
And this made a disagreeable impression on Levin .
The bright , cold August day , which had made Anna feel so hopeless , seemed to him keenly stimulating , and refreshed his face and neck that still tingled from the cold water .
She said herself she did not wish to change her position .
I &apos;ll tell you simply , &quot; said Varenka , and , without waiting for a reply , she went on : &quot; Yes , it brings up memories , once painful ones .
Of course , being a good @-@ hearted man , he liked men rather than he disliked them , and so too with the peasants .
&quot; The wreath wants setting straight , &quot; she answered , not hearing him .
And he will calmly and punctually act in accordance with his words .
&quot; Where is the humiliation ?
&quot; No , you &apos;re a lucky man !
But he had found a girl - he &apos;d show her to Vronsky - a marvel , exquisite , in the strict Oriental style , &quot; genre of the slave Rebecca , don &apos;t you know . &quot; He &apos;d had a row , too , with Berkoshov , and was going to send seconds to him , but of course it would come to nothing .
Vronsky moved into the middle of the crowd unnoticed , almost at the very moment when the bell rang at the finish of the race , and the tall , mudspattered horse @-@ guard who came in first , bending over the saddle , let go the reins of his panting gray horse that looked dark with sweat .
Divorce , the details of which he knew by this time , seemed to him now out of the question , because the sense of his own dignity and respect for religion forbade his taking upon himself a fictitious charge of adultery , and still more suffering his wife , pardoned and beloved by him , to be caught in the fact and put to public shame .
He painted studies from nature under the guidance of an Italian professor of painting , and studied mediæval Italian life .
How loathsome ! &quot; &quot; I was just going to say .... &quot; She interrupted him .
This quadrangular opening , in spite of the bosom &apos;s being very white , or just because it was very white , deprived Levin of the full use of his faculties .
Come on ! &quot; cried voices , and eating up their bread , the mowers went back to work .
His wife &apos;s staying away in the country was very agreeable to Stepan Arkadyevitch from every point of view : it did the children good , it decreased expenses , and it left him more at liberty .
Oblonsky could not restrain a slight mocking smile at the sight of Levin .
&quot; What a position ! &quot; he thought .
The waiter , who was busy with a party of engineers dining in the dining hall , came several times with an irate countenance in answer to her summons , and could not avoid carrying out her orders , as she gave them with such gracious insistence that there was no evading her .
Chapter 33 Kitty made the acquaintance of Madame Stahl too , and this acquaintance , together with her friendship with Varenka , did not merely exercise a great influence on her , it also comforted her in her mental distress .
As the house was damp , and only one bedroom had been kept heated , Levin put his brother to sleep in his own bedroom behind a screen .
Like some supper ?
But after spending two months alone in the country , he was convinced that this was not one of those passions of which he had had experience in his early youth ; that this feeling gave him not an instant &apos;s rest ; that he could not live without deciding the question , would she or would she not be his wife , and that his despair had arisen only from his own imaginings , that he had no sort of proof that he would be rejected .
And they have to find a support for themselves in inventing a policy .
&quot; Here , bring the light , Fyodor , this way , &quot; said Levin , examining the calf .
&quot; It will be lighter for you here , &quot; answered her sister @-@ in @-@ law .
Marya Nikolaevna smiled a sweet and good @-@ humored smile , which was at once reflected on Nikolay &apos;s face , and she took the bottle .
&quot; Why not ?
It &apos;s quite the contrary ; he is always in cheerful spirits abroad , but not as he is here .
As they finished their rows , the mowers , hot and good @-@ humored , came out into the road one after another , and , laughing a little , greeted the master .
At first her reading made no progress .
&quot; How does it serve you right ?
Alexey Alexandrovitch expressed the idea that the education of women is apt to be confounded with the emancipation of women , and that it is only so that it can be considered dangerous .
Last winter , soon after ... you came to see us , &quot; she said , with a guilty and at the same time confiding smile , &quot; all Dolly &apos;s children had scarlet fever , and he happened to come and see her .
&quot; I &apos;m happy , very happy ! &quot; he said to himself .
The coffee was never really made , but spluttered over everyone , and boiled away , doing just what was required of it - that is , providing much cause for much noise and laughter , and spoiling a costly rug and the baroness &apos;s gown .
As he pondered over subsequent developments , Alexey Alexandrovitch did not see , indeed , why his relations with his wife should not remain practically the same as before .
&quot; I am trying to find means of working productively for myself and for the laborers .
Alexey Alexandrovitch listened to her now , and those expressions which had seemed to him , if not distasteful , at least exaggerated , now seemed to him natural and consolatory .
&quot; Pity we didn &apos;t hear it ! &quot; said Princess Betsy , glancing towards the door .
_ Bonne chance , _ &quot; he added , smiling and he moved away from him .
They had made no agreement about this , it had settled itself .
All the habits and rules of his life that had seemed so firm , had turned out suddenly false and inapplicable .
Nice itself is dull enough , you know .
If a subject &apos;s given me , it &apos;s easy to spin something round it .
Charged with this commission , Betsy had gone to Anna , and brought him back a negative reply .
She was terrified again at this feeling , and clutched at the first pretext for doing something which might divert her thoughts from herself .
The weary , and at the same time passionate , glance of those eyes , encircled by dark rings , impressed one by its perfect sincerity .
Stepan Arkadyevitch , without hearing him out , laid his hand genially on the secretary &apos;s sleeve .
Either because the children saw that their mother was fond of this aunt , or that they felt a special charm in her themselves , the two elder ones , and the younger following their lead , as children so often do , had clung about their new aunt since before dinner , and would not leave her side .
Crossing the meadow , Konstantin Levin came out onto the road , and met an old man with a swollen eye , carrying a skep on his shoulder .
Chapter 3 &quot; You met him ? &quot; she asked , when they had sat down at the table in the lamplight .
Supposing I could arrange ....
It was an evil action , of course , but it was the sole means of escape , and better not to brood over these fearful facts .
Words for him took away the beauty of what he saw .
&quot; But you see you don &apos;t throw it up , &quot; said Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky ; &quot; so there must be something gained . &quot; &quot; The only gain is that I live in my own house , neither bought nor hired .
He did not raise his head , but simply turned his eyes upwards , without their reaching his brother &apos;s face .
He was five years older than Levin , and had long been married .
&quot; Yes , I forgive you ; but it &apos;s terrible ! &quot; But his happiness was so immense that this confession did not shatter it , it only added another shade to it .
&quot; There are as many such Englishmen as there would be women officials , &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch .
And now he poured out upon Stepan Arkadyevitch his poetic joy in the spring , and his failures and plans for the land , and his thoughts and criticisms on the books he had been reading , and the idea of his own book , the basis of which really was , though he was unaware of it himself , a criticism of all the old books on agriculture .
Chapter 10 From that time a new life began for Alexey Alexandrovitch and for his wife .
Such a talking , and such a to @-@ do , that one would have cause to regret it .
He was going to say that he had been up all night and had dropped asleep , but looking at her thrilled and rapturous face , he was ashamed .
The laborers with us , the peasants , bear all the burden of labor , and are so placed that however much they work they can &apos;t escape from their position of beasts of burden .
What an appetite I get in the country !
Most important of all - he must get back without delay : he would have to make haste to put his new project to the peasants before the sowing of the winter wheat , so that the sowing might be undertaken on a new basis .
The sensation produced by Princess Myakaya &apos;s speeches was always unique , and the secret of the sensation she produced lay in the fact that though she spoke not always appropriately , as now , she said simple things with some sense in them .
Levin still continued in the same delirious condition in which it seemed to him that he and his happiness constituted the chief and sole aim of all existence , and that he need not now think or care about anything , that everything was being done and would be done for him by others .
She wrote , _ t , i , c , n , a , d _ .
&quot; That &apos;s all over for me , &quot; he said to himself .
Levin was grateful to Oblonsky for noticing , with his never @-@ failing tact , that he dreaded conversation about the Shtcherbatskys , and so saying nothing about them .
All he did was to agree entirely with everything suggested to him .
Now the peasants about us buy land , and I don &apos;t mind that .
Those who had not succeeded in getting into the main entrance were crowding about the windows , pushing , wrangling , and peeping through the gratings .
Kouzma had not thought of leaving out a clean shirt , and on receiving instructions to pack up everything and send it round to the Shtcherbatskys &quot; house , from which the young people were to set out the same evening , he had done so , packing everything but the dress suit .
&quot; Turbot ?
Both morally and physically she had changed for the worse .
It was Levin &apos;s face , with his scowling brows , and his kind eyes looking out in dark dejection below them , as he stood listening to her father , and glancing at her and at Vronsky .
But he saw that this was essential for her .
&quot; Don &apos;t talk of it !
The colonel , thinking it all over , made up his mind not to pursue the matter further , but then for his own satisfaction proceeded to cross @-@ examine Vronsky about his interview ; and it was a long while before he could restrain his laughter , as Vronsky described how the government clerk , after subsiding for a while , would suddenly flare up again , as he recalled the details , and how Vronsky , at the last half word of conciliation , skillfully manœuvered a retreat , shoving Petritsky out before him .
You can &apos;t imagine how you will grieve my wife and me . &quot; The way in which Alexey Alexandrovitch saw his brother @-@ in @-@ law out was very different from the manner in which he had met him .
Whether she felt remorse at having won Levin &apos;s love , or at having refused him , she did not know .
Under the influence of her mood he felt in all his being a continually growing tension of happiness .
Why do you ask ? &quot; &quot; Give us another bottle , &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch directed the Tatar , who was filling up their glasses and fidgeting round them just when he was not wanted .
She was calmer now , and her face lighted up with a tender smile .
to be so mistaken in people ! &quot; said the princess , and by the change in her tone both Dolly and the prince knew she was speaking of Vronsky .
&quot; Imagine !
&quot; Soon , soon .
The position of uncertainty , of indecision , was still the same as at home - worse , in fact , since it was impossible to take any step , impossible to see Vronsky , and she had to remain here among outsiders , in company so uncongenial to her present mood .
Soon after Prince Kaluzhsky arrived , and Liza Merkalova with Stremov .
What a queer fellow he is ! &quot; added Stepan Arkadyevitch .
He gave orders for the wheat to be delivered , sent the bailiff to the merchant to get the money owing him , and went out himself to give some final directions on the estate before setting off .
You can see by that whether I guess right or wrong , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , gazing at Levin with a subtle smile .
They say he was the only support of an immense family .
&quot; No .
Chapter 8 Alexey Alexandrovitch had seen nothing striking or improper in the fact that his wife was sitting with Vronsky at a table apart , in eager conversation with him about something .
The children ran wild all over the house ; the English governess quarreled with the housekeeper , and wrote to a friend asking her to look out for a new situation for her ; the man @-@ cook had walked off the day before just at dinner time ; the kitchen @-@ maid , and the coachman had given warning .
&quot; Believe me , I appreciate it , and I hope you won &apos;t regret it , &quot; answered Stepan Arkadyevitch , smiling .
&quot; I &apos;ve put a muzzle on her , and the mare &apos;s fidgety .
He had cut the whole of the meadow in front of his house , and this year ever since the early spring he had cherished a plan for mowing for whole days together with the peasants .
In the commission this question had been a ground of contention between several departments .
&quot; Yes , that is a hateful position !
He began to think of her , of what she was thinking and feeling .
Some higher power might do it . &quot; &quot; Oh , well , the higher power of Ryabinin can .
Now that he had opened his heart , he became as he had been in the morning .
&quot; Send to my house , and tell them to have out the carriage and three horses as quick as they can , &quot; he said to the servant , who handed him the steak on a hot silver dish , and moving the dish up he began eating .
I never believed her lungs were affected . &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m very glad ! &quot; said Levin , and Dolly fancied she saw something touching , helpless , in his face as he said this and looked silently into her face .
He tried to say something , but he could not speak for excitement , and pretended to be coughing .
Thank God . &quot; &quot; You had a good journey ? &quot; said her son , sitting down beside her , and involuntarily listening to a woman &apos;s voice outside the door .
&quot; I was beginning to think you meant to run away , &quot; she said , and smiled to him .
It &apos;s very nice for you to have over six thousand acres in the Karazinsky district , and such muscles , and the freshness of a girl of twelve ; still you &apos;ll be one of us one day .
The little old priest in his ecclesiastical cap , with his long silvery @-@ gray locks of hair parted behind his ears , was fumbling with something at the lectern , putting out his little old hands from under the heavy silver vestment with the gold cross on the back of it .
They were disputing about the misappropriation of certain sums and the laying of certain pipes , and Sergey Ivanovitch was very cutting to two members , and said something at great length with an air of triumph ; and another member , scribbling something on a bit of paper , began timidly at first , but afterwards answered him very viciously and delightfully .
&quot; Come , what do they say about the new act I have got passed in the council ? &quot; Anna had heard nothing of this act , and she felt conscience @-@ stricken at having been able so readily to forget what was to him of such importance .
But your husband ought to be above that , &quot; Betsy was saying .
What do they want to argue for ?
&quot; No , they must needs teach us how to live .
&quot; Hand over that telegram ! &quot; came an angry voice out of the stormy darkness on the other side .
&quot; You always get younger , Bondarenko , &quot; he said to the rosy @-@ checked , smart @-@ looking quartermaster standing just before him , still youngish looking though doing his second term of service .
&quot; I knew ! &quot; And her son , like her husband , aroused in Anna a feeling akin to disappointment .
Look at Mazankov , at Krupov .
But what if they had no such medicinal property ? &quot; he wound up humorously .
I positively walked the whole way , but I am here at my time .
Apart from the fact that the sight of this happy and affectionate couple , so pleased with themselves and everyone else , and their well @-@ ordered home had always a cheering effect on Levin , he felt a longing , now that he was so dissatisfied with his own life , to get at that secret in Sviazhsky that gave him such clearness , definiteness , and good courage in life .
Levin had meant to tell his brother of his determination to get married , and to ask his advice ; he had indeed firmly resolved to do so .
There &apos;s no great harm done .
To conceal this embarrassment he took out a cigarette case he had just bought that opened in a new way , and sniffing the leather , took a cigarette out of it .
As he listened to his brother &apos;s argument with the professor , he noticed that they connected these scientific questions with those spiritual problems , that at times they almost touched on the latter ; but every time they were close upon what seemed to him the chief point , they promptly beat a hasty retreat , and plunged again into a sea of subtle distinctions , reservations , quotations , allusions , and appeals to authorities , and it was with difficulty that he understood what they were talking about .
A cart with the seed in it was standing , not at the edge , but in the middle of the crop , and the winter corn had been torn up by the wheels and trampled by the horse .
Without giving himself a reason for what he was doing , he strained every nerve of his being for those two days , simply to preserve an appearance of composure , and even of indifference .
Thoughts of Tanya as a marquise , of Dolly , all had vanished .
&quot; Glad to see me , but you didn &apos;t let me know .
What would you have with such a set of peasants ?
She felt as though her nerves were strings being strained tighter and tighter on some sort of screwing peg .
On one side that memory was too awful to be thought of .
&quot; Ah !
&quot; But don &apos;t worry , it &apos;ll be brought directly . &quot; &quot; No , what is to be done ! &quot; said Levin , with smothered fury .
For whom the labor ?
I know him very well .
&quot; As it is , she &apos;s been eating nothing lately and is losing her looks , and then you must come and upset her with your nonsense , &quot; she said to him .
Levin felt that it would be improper to enter upon a metaphysical discussion with the priest , and so he said in reply merely what was a direct answer to the question .
On reaching home Oblonsky helped his sister out , sighed , pressed her hand , and set off to his office .
&quot; Yes , he &apos;s a very remarkable man ; rather a conservative , but a splendid man , &quot; observed Stepan Arkadyevitch , &quot; a splendid man . &quot; &quot; Oh , well , so much the better for him , &quot; said Vronsky smiling .
Remember that . &quot; &quot; I can never forget what is my whole life .
For the first two days after his wife &apos;s departure Alexey Alexandrovitch received applicants for assistance and his chief secretary , drove to the committee , and went down to dinner in the dining @-@ room as usual .
He was sitting raised up with one elbow on the bed , his long back bent , and his head hanging low .
But this dream weighed on her like a nightmare , and she awoke from it in terror .
I &apos;m not angry with her , &quot; said Levin .
&quot; Yes , I used to study long ago , and now I have begun to do a little , &quot; said Vronsky , reddening .
Chapter 32 The first person to meet Anna at home was her son .
Today he was too much agitated .
He was unmistakably bored by Golenishtchev &apos;s conversation , and he did not attempt to oppose him .
Tell me yourself what will give you true happiness and peace to your soul .
Vronsky disliked it , yet he felt that Golenishtchev was unhappy , and was sorry for him .
&quot; I shall be wretched .
Her hand shook as it played with a leaf she had picked .
Stepping lightly , and continually glancing at her husband , showing him a valorous and sympathetic face , Kitty went into the sick @-@ room , and , turning without haste , noiselessly closed the door .
When they met him , with ill @-@ disguised enjoyment they inquired after his wife &apos;s health .
I understand that a woman &apos;s word , a woman &apos;s superintendence is needed .
Schools can do no good ; what will do good is an economic organization in which the people will become richer , will have more leisure - and then there will be schools . &quot; &quot; Still , all over Europe now schools are obligatory . &quot; &quot; And how far do you agree with Spencer yourself about it ? &quot; asked Levin .
( Many people gained their livelihood by the Board of Irrigation , especially one highly conscientious and musical family : all the daughters played on stringed instruments , and Alexey Alexandrovitch knew the family and had stood godfather to one of the elder daughters . )
&quot; The train &apos;s signaled , &quot; answered the man .
To say nothing of the young men who danced at the Moscow balls being almost all in love with Kitty , two serious suitors had already this first winter made their appearance : Levin , and immediately after his departure , Count Vronsky .
It was half @-@ past eight already .
But at first , when he did not yet feel secure in his position , he knew it would affect too many interests , and would be injudicious .
She went quickly to him , and whispered something .
&quot; _ Pardon !
You &apos;ll say again that I &apos;m a reactionist , or some other terrible word ; but all the same it does annoy and anger me to see on all sides the impoverishing of the nobility to which I belong , and , in spite of the amalgamation of classes , I &apos;m glad to belong .
Slapping Turovtsin on the shoulder , he whispered something comic in his ear , and set him down by his wife and the old prince .
Chapter 7 The next day was Sunday .
But the footman had not come to call them again , as he supposed .
Her daughter made her no reply , only in her heart she thought that one could not talk about exaggeration where Christianity was concerned .
But these cares and anxieties were for Darya Alexandrovna the sole happiness possible .
Though I can fancy that , used to town housekeeping as you are , you must feel in the wilds here , and if there &apos;s anything wanted , I &apos;m altogether at your disposal . &quot; &quot; Oh , no ! &quot; said Dolly .
Levin went into the pen , looked Pava over , and lifted the red and spotted calf onto her long , tottering legs .
It &apos;s such rubbish , such lying , such self @-@ deception .
how good you are ! &quot; cried Kitty , and stopping her , she kissed her .
He shaved , took a cold bath , dressed and went out .
It happened that the famous Commission of the 2nd of June had set on foot an inquiry into the irrigation of lands in the Zaraisky province , which fell under Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s department , and was a glaring example of fruitless expenditure and paper reforms .
Chapter 13 When they rose from table , Levin would have liked to follow Kitty into the drawing @-@ room ; but he was afraid she might dislike this , as too obviously paying her attention .
&quot; Do you believe in all the doctrines of the Holy Apostolic Church ? &quot; the priest went on , turning his eyes away from Levin &apos;s face and folding his hands under his stole .
That day Alexey Alexandrovitch went into the boudoir where Vronsky was sitting , and closing the door sat down opposite him .
All the three buttons buttoned up without tearing on the long glove that covered her hand without concealing its lines .
But the schools , anyway . &quot; &quot; Why have schools ? &quot; &quot; What do you mean ?
But a third series of ideas turned upon the question how to effect this transition from the old life to the new .
The two girls used to meet several times a day , and every time they met , Kitty &apos;s eyes said : &quot; Who are you ?
He went up the steps , and turning to the right saw the priest .
He listened , and read his book , and recalled the whole train of ideas suggested by his reading .
The mare , excited by Gladiator &apos;s keeping ahead , had risen too soon before the barrier , and grazed it with her hind hoofs .
&quot; Yes ; but he left rather early . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s a capital fellow , &quot; pursued Oblonsky .
Have you brought your wife ? &quot; &quot; No , baroness .
The weather had become worse than ever towards evening ; the hail lashed the drenched mare so cruelly that she went along sideways , shaking her head and ears ; but Levin was all right under his hood , and he looked cheerfully about him at the muddy streams running under the wheels , at the drops hanging on every bare twig , at the whiteness of the patch of unmelted hailstones on the planks of the bridge , at the thick layer of still juicy , fleshy leaves that lay heaped up about the stripped elm @-@ tree .
He supported this view by the fact that no family can get on without women to help ; that in every family , poor or rich , there are and must be nurses , either relations or hired .
He &apos;s good @-@ hearted , but he &apos;s proud , and now he &apos;s so humiliated .
But I know him differently .
What do I know ?
can it be he ? &quot; Every time he spoke to Anna the joyous light flashed into her eyes , and the smile of happiness curved her red lips .
Often one wonders what is the goal of this life ? ...
But since her visit to Moscow she had done quite the contrary .
Konstantin felt a sharp pang at his heart at the thought of the strange company in which his brother spent his life .
Turovtsin exploded in a loud roar of laughter and Sergey Ivanovitch regretted that he had not made this comparison .
The tone of her dark dress ( Anna immediately observed and appreciated the fact ) was in perfect harmony with her style of beauty .
&quot; _ Quos vult perdere dementat _ , &quot; he said , meaning by _ quos _ the persons responsible for this appointment .
My God !
Levin &apos;s a thousand times the better man .
He walked on a few steps , and the skating @-@ ground lay open before his eyes , and at once , amidst all the skaters , he knew her .
His face was clever and manly , but his dress was dandified and in bad taste .
They asked my husband and me to dinner , and told us the sauce at that dinner cost a hundred pounds , &quot; Princess Myakaya said , speaking loudly , and conscious everyone was listening ; &quot; and very nasty sauce it was , some green mess .
He dined with the old man , and talked to him about his family affairs , taking the keenest interest in them , and told him about his own affairs and all the circumstances that could be of interest to the old man .
&quot; No ; he &apos;s only three months old , &quot; answered Darya Alexandrovna with pride .
&quot; What shall we drink ? &quot; &quot; What you like , only not too much .
She began fluttering like a caged bird , at one moment would have got up and moved away , at the next turned to Betsy .
&quot; Pray walk in , &quot; said the lawyer , addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch ; and , gloomily ushering Karenin in before him , he closed the door .
The whole gown was trimmed with Venetian guipure .
And then she does so much good !
Just now , since his disenchantment with farming , Levin was particularly glad to stay with Sviazhsky .
Vronsky was never at Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s house , but Anna saw him away from home , and her husband was aware of it .
Sergey Ivanovitch liked to stretch himself on the grass in the sun , and to lie so , basking and chatting lazily .
Both of them now had only one thought - the illness of Nikolay and the nearness of his death - which stifled all else .
He went out of the door without a word , and at once stumbled over Marya Nikolaevna , who had heard of his arrival and had not dared to go in to see him .
&quot; I must think it over , come to a decision , and put it out of my mind , &quot; he said aloud .
No , really he &apos;s a capital fellow . &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch glanced at his watch .
He thanked her by a smile , and sat down beside her .
But that did not prevent her from regarding it as a matter of great importance .
Of course there is the expression of an official in Pilate and of pity in Christ , seeing that one is the incarnation of the fleshly and the other of the spiritual life .
He was a constant visitor at their house .
But he always felt the injustice of his own abundance in comparison with the poverty of the peasants , and now he determined that so as to feel quite in the right , though he had worked hard and lived by no means luxuriously before , he would now work still harder , and would allow himself even less luxury .
The arrangement was the more suitable as , immediately after the wedding , the young people were to go to the country , where the more important part of the trousseau would not be wanted .
&quot; Varya , &quot; he said , looking sternly at her , &quot; I shot myself by accident .
After dinner , however , Kitty got up and went as usual with her work to the sick man .
Though many of the plans with which he had returned to the country had not been carried out , still his most important resolution - that of purity - had been kept by him .
Yes , if there has been nothing that ought not to have been , old as I am , I &apos;d have called him out to the barrier , the young dandy .
&quot; It only seems strange to me that it can ever have been otherwise . &quot; &quot; Stiva says that _ he _ has agreed to everything , but I can &apos;t accept _ his _ generosity , &quot; she said , looking dreamily past Vronsky &apos;s face .
She &apos;s a brunette , and it won &apos;t suit her .... I &apos;ve worked it all out . &quot; Hearing why he had come , the princess was half humorously , half seriously angry with him , and sent him home to dress and not to hinder Kitty &apos;s hair @-@ dressing , as Charles the hair @-@ dresser was just coming .
If no system of husbandry answered at all without these improvements , you would be quite right .
They draw a sort of line that can &apos;t be crossed between them and their families .
It will be the same thing too with this trouble .
&quot; It &apos;s early for me to be fetched , and for anyone else it &apos;s late , &quot; observed Kitty .
Go and see her , if you &apos;re not too tired , my dear .
&quot; Yes , I &apos;m writing the second part of the _ Two Elements _ , &quot; said Golenishtchev , coloring with pleasure at the question - &quot; that is , to be exact , I am not writing it yet ; I am preparing , collecting materials .
And pity in her womanly heart did not arouse at all that feeling of horror and loathing that it aroused in her husband , but a desire to act , to find out all the details of his state , and to remedy them .
&quot; I tell you , that if you go , I shall come with you ; I shall certainly come , &quot; she said hastily and wrathfully .
He saw that a sigh was held back in her throat , and the little hand in the long glove shook as it held the candle .
&quot; Oh , that &apos;s only an old study , &quot; he said .
&quot; Tell her we don &apos;t haggle over fees ! &quot; he said , and returned to Alexey Alexandrovitch .
Hoping to find her alone , Vronsky alighted , as he always did , to avoid attracting attention , before crossing the bridge , and walked to the house .
He even fancied that he smiled .
&quot; I did go , but late .
Mademoiselle Linon was in great haste , and leaving him , went out at the other door .
So it had to be , and I cannot complain of anyone or anything .
&quot; How nicely we would arrange it ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;d come and see you if I were sure I should not find Sergey Ivanovitch . &quot; &quot; You wouldn &apos;t find him there .
The more she got to know Vronsky , the more she loved him .
There they certainly did drink a little too much , as one always does at farewell dinners .
&quot; Let &apos;s go into the billiard room , &quot; he said .
At that moment in the next room a child began to cry ; probably it had fallen down .
She always set to work on it at depressed moments , and now she knitted at it nervously , twitching her fingers and counting the stitches .
&quot; If you want to hear my confession of faith on the subject , I tell you that in your quarrel with Sergey Ivanovitch I take neither side .
But he &apos;s a queer fish , and quite without breeding .
&quot; I begged to nurse her , I wasn &apos;t allowed to , and now I &apos;m blamed for it . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t blame .... &quot; &quot; Yes , you do blame me !
She would never know freedom in love , but would remain forever a guilty wife , with the menace of detection hanging over her at every instant ; deceiving her husband for the sake of a shameful connection with a man living apart and away from her , whose life she could never share .
&quot; What did you consider unbecoming ? &quot; she repeated .
Shall we give a supper on Sunday for the _ diva ? _ &quot; he said to him with a smile , taking his arm .
A dry @-@ looking Englishman , in high boots and a short jacket , clean @-@ shaven , except for a tuft below his chin , came to meet him , walking with the uncouth gait of jockey , turning his elbows out and swaying from side to side .
For me the district institutions simply mean the liability to pay fourpence halfpenny for every three acres , to drive into the town , sleep with bugs , and listen to all sorts of idiocy and loathsomeness , and self @-@ interest offers me no inducement . &quot; &quot; Excuse me , &quot; Sergey Ivanovitch interposed with a smile , &quot; self @-@ interest did not induce us to work for the emancipation of the serfs , but we did work for it . &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; Konstantin Levin broke in with still greater heat ; &quot; the emancipation of the serfs was a different matter .
&quot; Poor fellow !
&quot; Ah ! &quot; responded Yashvin .
&quot; It &apos;s exquisite - such lightness , precision . &quot; He said to her the same thing he said to almost all his partners whom he knew well .
He had thought his engagement would have nothing about it like others , that the ordinary conditions of engaged couples would spoil his special happiness ; but it ended in his doing exactly as other people did , and his happiness being only increased thereby and becoming more and more special , more and more unlike anything that had ever happened .
I &apos;ll tell you what for ! &quot; Nikolay Levin shrieked suddenly at the name of Sergey Ivanovitch .
the sight of him has a physical effect on me , it makes me beside myself .
At seven o &apos;clock there was a noise of people polishing the floors , and bells ringing in some servants &quot; department , and Levin felt that he was beginning to get frozen .
Sergey Ivanovitch was fond of angling , and was , it seemed , proud of being able to care for such a stupid occupation .
Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced with his weary eyes at Vronsky .
Often Levin had admired this life , often he had a sense of envy of the men who led this life ; but today for the first time , especially under the influence of what he had seen in the attitude of Ivan Parmenov to his young wife , the idea presented itself definitely to his mind that it was in his power to exchange the dreary , artificial , idle , and individualistic life he was leading for this laborious , pure , and socially delightful life .
The whole ball , the whole world , everything seemed lost in fog in Kitty &apos;s soul .
Masha , pass us some junket or raspberries . &quot; He turned to his wife .
Levin tried through her to get a solution of the weighty enigma her husband presented to his mind ; but he had not complete freedom of ideas , because he was in an agony of embarrassment .
Or perhaps it is thirty .
With fresh force , he felt conscious of himself from the springy motions of his legs to the movements of his lungs as he breathed , and something set his lips twitching .
And then that portrait of me he did so well .
No , what &apos;s wanted is a powerful party of independent men like you and me . &quot; &quot; But why so ? &quot; Vronsky mentioned a few men who were in power .
But the mistake made by him had arisen not simply from his having overlooked that contingency , but also from the fact that until that day of his interview with his dying wife , he had not known his own heart .
All the way he thought no more of what he ought to do .
These matters , together with the management of the land still left on his hands , and the indoor work over his book , so engrossed Levin the whole summer that he scarcely ever went out shooting .
Tell me how you do it ? &quot; &quot; I do nothing , &quot; answered Anna , blushing at these searching questions .
Or shall we go somewhere ?
Apart from this , there remained a vague memory that what the kind , nice old fellow had said had not been at all so stupid as he had fancied at first , and that there was something in it that must be cleared up .
&quot; That &apos;s all splendid , &quot; thought Kitty , catching the words , &quot; all that &apos;s just as it should be , &quot; and a smile of happiness , unconsciously reflected in everyone who looked at her , beamed on her radiant face .
He was well acquainted with the way dilettanti have ( the cleverer they were the worse he found them ) of looking at the works of contemporary artists with the sole object of being in a position to say that art is a thing of the past , and that the more one sees of the new men the more one sees how inimitable the works of the great old masters have remained .
&quot; I can understand being carried away by feeling , &quot; she went on after a brief silence , &quot; but deliberately , slyly deceiving me ... and with whom ? ...
He opened both the movable panes in his window and sat down to the table opposite the open panes .
&quot; What business is it of theirs ! &quot; thought Vronsky , and crumpling up the letters he thrust them between the buttons of his coat so as to read them carefully on the road .
In the same way Levin in his heart despised the town mode of life of his friend , and his official duties , which he laughed at , and regarded as trifling .
&quot; Please step in , &quot; he said , trying to look indifferent , and going into the passage he took a key out of his pocket and opened the door .
&quot; It &apos;s not for my husband ; for myself I don &apos;t wish it .
She felt that this evening , when they would both meet for the first time , would be a turning point in her life .
At last the guilty Kouzma flew panting into the room with the shirt .
We got here first .
Another letter had to be written to Vronsky .
Close by was standing a flaxen @-@ headed Swedish count , whom Kitty knew by name .
Called him out and shot him ! _ &quot; Everyone had apparently shared this feeling , though from politeness they had not expressed it .
&quot; It was that Thérèse you used to know ? &quot; &quot; I was just saying .... &quot; &quot; How disgusting you are , you men !
More than any other style he liked the French - graceful and effective - and in that style he began to paint Anna &apos;s portrait in Italian costume , and the portrait seemed to him , and to everyone who saw it , extremely successful .
At that moment one of the young men , the best of the skaters of the day , came out of the coffee @-@ house in his skates , with a cigarette in his mouth .
Levin could never have conceived that between him and his wife any relations could arise other than tender , respectful and loving , and all at once in the very early days they quarreled , so that she said he did not care for her , that he cared for no one but himself , burst into tears , and wrung her arms .
But a capital road .
Levin ate the oysters indeed , though white bread and cheese would have pleased him better .
&quot; So it is to be , &quot; thought Kitty , and all the blood seemed to rush to her heart .
&quot; We ran up against each other in the doorway . &quot; &quot; And he bowed to you like this ? &quot; She drew a long face , and half @-@ closing her eyes , quickly transformed her expression , folded her hands , and Vronsky suddenly saw in her beautiful face the very expression with which Alexey Alexandrovitch had bowed to him .
Instead of being hurt , denying , defending himself , begging forgiveness , instead of remaining indifferent even - anything would have been better than what he did do - his face utterly involuntarily ( reflex spinal action , reflected Stepan Arkadyevitch , who was fond of physiology ) - utterly involuntarily assumed its habitual , good @-@ humored , and therefore idiotic smile .
Stepan Arkadyevitch went to the Grand Theater to a rehearsal of the ballet , and gave Masha Tchibisova , a pretty dancing @-@ girl whom he had just taken under his protection , the coral necklace he had promised her the evening before , and behind the scenes in the dim daylight of the theater , managed to kiss her pretty little face , radiant over her present .
But will you please go to the front door ; there are servants there , &quot; the gardener answered .
In the old days she had dressed for her own sake to look pretty and be admired .
Chapter 10 Pestsov liked thrashing an argument out to the end , and was not satisfied with Sergey Ivanovitch &apos;s words , especially as he felt the injustice of his view .
Who has clothed the earth in its beauty ?
He could do nothing but try to help the aching place to bear it , and this he tried to do .
The race was an unlucky one , and of the seventeen officers who rode in it more than half were thrown and hurt .
&quot; That &apos;s capital . &quot; &quot; I did not venture to disregard your excellency &apos;s commands , though the road was extremely bad .
Misfortunes never come singly , and the affairs of the reorganization of the native tribes , and of the irrigation of the lands of the Zaraisky province , had brought such official worries upon Alexey Alexandrovitch that he had been of late in a continual condition of extreme irritability .
But as for the proposal made by Levin - to take a part as shareholder with his laborers in each agricultural undertaking - at this the bailiff simply expressed a profound despondency , and offered no definite opinion , but began immediately talking of the urgent necessity of carrying the remaining sheaves of rye the next day , and of sending the men out for the second ploughing , so that Levin felt that this was not the time for discussing it .
They seemed to Levin an elect band of blissful beings because they were here , near her .
But Frou @-@ Frou drew up her legs and back in the very act of leaping , like a falling cat , and , clearing the other mare , alighted beyond her .
Where have you been ? &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , when the peasant had gone .
The visitors &quot; doors were closed and everything was asleep .
&quot; I presume that your husband has told you the grounds on which I consider it necessary to change my attitude to Anna Arkadyevna ? &quot; he said , not looking her in the face , but eyeing with displeasure Shtcherbatsky , who was walking across the drawing @-@ room .
And here is what I had begun writing , thinking I could say it better by letter , and that my presence irritates her , &quot; he said , as he gave him the letter .
&quot; I &apos;m not well ; I &apos;ve grown irritable , &quot; said Nikolay Levin , getting calmer and breathing painfully ; &quot; and then you talk to me of Sergey Ivanovitch and his article .
Alexey Alexandrovitch stroked his son &apos;s hair , answered the governess &apos;s inquiries about his wife , and asked what the doctor had said of the baby .
In the middle of the old man &apos;s account of his acquaintance with Sviazhsky , the gates creaked again , and laborers came into the yard from the fields , with wooden ploughs and harrows .
At last , as though making an effort over herself , she got up and pushed him away .
It all lies in the subject .
The most horrible thing is , &quot; she began , but did not finish her thought , because Matrona Philimonovna put her head in at the door .
Vronsky liked him both for his exceptional physical strength , which he showed for the most part by being able to drink like a fish , and do without sleep without being in the slightest degree affected by it ; and for his great strength of character , which he showed in his relations with his comrades and superior officers , commanding both fear and respect , and also at cards , when he would play for tens of thousands and however much he might have drunk , always with such skill and decision that he was reckoned the best player in the English Club .
&quot; Yes , yes , that &apos;s how it is , sir ! &quot; said the old man , getting up , and crossing himself deliberately , he thanked Levin and went out .
Those eyes were shining nearer and nearer , blinding him with their light of love .
And find out whether Count Anitchkin &quot; ( this was the new head ) &quot; is receiving . &quot; &quot; Yes , sir , &quot; Vassily responded , smiling .
_ Cela n &apos;est pas plus fin que ça _ , when you get a peep at their cards .
Soon after her return from Moscow , on arriving at a _ soirée _ where she had expected to meet him , and not finding him there , she realized distinctly from the rush of disappointment that she had been deceiving herself , and that this pursuit was not merely not distasteful to her , but that it made the whole interest of her life .
The women , all singing , began to come close to Levin , and he felt as though a storm were swooping down upon him with a thunder of merriment .
She went out with the rapid step which bore her rather fully @-@ developed figure with such strange lightness .
But like or dislike &quot; the people &quot; as something apart he could not , not only because he lived with &quot; the people , &quot; and all his interests were bound up with theirs , but also because he regarded himself as a part of &quot; the people , &quot; did not see any special qualities or failings distinguishing himself and &quot; the people , &quot; and could not contrast himself with them .
He was equable and not cringing with his superiors , was free and ingratiating in his behavior with his equals , and was contemptuously indulgent with his inferiors .
He felt himself , and did not want to be anyone else .
Now , though his conviction that jealousy was a shameful feeling and that one ought to feel confidence , had not broken down , he felt that he was standing face to face with something illogical and irrational , and did not know what was to be done .
&quot; So you &apos;re not afraid of getting fat ? &quot; said the latter , turning a chair round for the young officer .
&quot; If you want to go out , let &apos;s go together , &quot; he said , disinclined to be parted from his brother , who seemed positively breathing out freshness and energy .
&quot; I imagine , &quot; he said , &quot; that no sort of activity is likely to be lasting if it is not founded on self @-@ interest , that &apos;s a universal principle , a philosophical principle , &quot; he said , repeating the word &quot; philosophical &quot; with determination , as though wishing to show that he had as much right as anyone else to talk of philosophy .
Do you suppose I could help knowing ?
She knew beforehand that everything would go on in the old way , and far worse , indeed , than in the old way .
He did not undress , but walked up and down with his regular tread over the resounding parquet of the dining @-@ room , where one lamp was burning , over the carpet of the dark drawing @-@ room , in which the light was reflected on the big new portrait of himself hanging over the sofa , and across her boudoir , where two candles burned , lighting up the portraits of her parents and woman friends , and the pretty knick @-@ knacks of her writing @-@ table , that he knew so well .
&quot; She says that ! &quot; cried Levin .
She lifted her head .
But that he had quarreled with the head official , and was on his way back to Moscow , only he had been taken so ill on the road that it was doubtful if he would ever leave his bed again , she wrote .
&quot; I know it ; I know for certain .
Alexey Alexandrovitch cracked his fingers and bowed his head .
&quot; But don &apos;t let &apos;s talk of it .
She was looking out of the window , and had been for over half an hour anxiously expecting to hear from the best man that her bridegroom was at the church .
&quot; Oh , if it were merely a misunderstanding ! ... &quot; &quot; Pardon , I understand , &quot; interposed Stepan Arkadyevitch .
Levin told his wife that he believed she wanted to go simply in order to be of use , agreed that Marya Nikolaevna &apos;s being with his brother did not make her going improper , but he set off at the bottom of his heart dissatisfied both with her and with himself .
She did not stir , but thrusting her nose into the ground , she simply gazed at her master with her speaking eyes .
Forgive me for having troubled you .
There was such a frozen surface on the snow that they drove the wagons anywhere off the roads .
&quot; I &apos;m telling him to come to dinner .
&quot; No , I must go , I must go &quot; ; she explained to her sister @-@ in @-@ law the change in her plans in a tone that suggested that she had to remember so many things that there was no enumerating them : &quot; no , it had really better be today ! &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch was not dining at home , but he promised to come and see his sister off at seven o &apos;clock .
But his comrades were at once aware that he was not only going there .
At the crossroads by Gazetoy Place , where there are always crowds of carriages and sledges , Alexey Alexandrovitch suddenly heard his name called out in such a loud and cheerful voice that he could not help looking round .
This is not a matter of myself individually ; the question of the public welfare comes into it .
I wish he &apos;d turn round ... I &apos;ll _ will _ him to ! &quot; and she opened her eyes wide , as though to intensify the influence of her gaze .
She did not go out principally because the dress she had reckoned upon was not ready .
All the profits of labor , on which they might improve their position , and gain leisure for themselves , and after that education , all the surplus values are taken from them by the capitalists .
Her only desire now was to be rid of his oppressive presence .
She guessed at something which she could not tell her mother , which she did not put into words to herself .
&quot; What !
I liked him so much , &quot; Anna continued .
Seryozha came in preceded by his governess .
&quot; Shut up ! &quot; He turned over and opened his eyes .
But apparently she did not care to pursue the conversation in that strain , and she turned to the old countess .
Dolly for her part knew all she had wanted to find out .
Absorbed in such dreams , carefully keeping his horse by the hedges , so as not to trample his young crops , he rode up to the laborers who had been sent to sow clover .
I am a savage .
&quot; Here , I opened your letter too , &quot; said Kitty , handing him an illiterate letter .
And so am I.
Her indisposition was a symptom that she was with child .
A few instants later the platform was quivering , and with puffs of steam hanging low in the air from the frost , the engine rolled up , with the lever of the middle wheel rhythmically moving up and down , and the stooping figure of the engine @-@ driver covered with frost .
&quot; I hope I may have the honor of calling on you , &quot; he said .
&quot; You choose what we &apos;re to drink , &quot; he said , handing him the card , and looking at him .
Her soul was flooded with happiness .
&quot; All the same I don &apos;t agree with you , &quot; said the lady &apos;s voice .
Ah , how sweet she is !
&quot; No , it &apos;s out of the question , out of the question ! &quot; he said again , twisting his rug about him again .
He had gone out as far as the first step of the balcony and was loudly shouting across the band that played Offenbach &apos;s quadrille , waving his arms and giving some orders to a few soldiers standing on one side .
Here he is ! &quot; was almost always said with a smile of delight on meeting him .
When the visitors had gone , Mihailov sat down opposite the picture of Pilate and Christ , and in his mind went over what had been said , and what , though not said , had been implied by those visitors .
&quot; What is it ?
The peasant women , with their rakes on their shoulders , gay with bright flowers , and chattering with ringing , merry voices , walked behind the hay cart .
Her cheeks were flushed crimson , her eyes glittered , her little white hands thrust out from the sleeves of her dressing gown were playing with the quilt , twisting it about .
&quot; Have you passed a good night ? &quot; he asked , bowing to her and her husband together , and leaving it up to Alexey Alexandrovitch to accept the bow on his own account , and to recognize it or not , as he might see fit .
The people are at such a low stage of rational and moral development , that it &apos;s obvious they &apos;re bound to oppose everything that &apos;s strange to them .
He smelt the awful odor , saw the dirt , disorder , and miserable condition , and heard the groans , and felt that nothing could be done to help .
But he was silent .
Another feeling , even stronger , impelled him as quickly as possible to smooth over the rupture without letting it grow greater .
You &apos;re pale .
Her lips were quivering .
Chapter 12 Connected with the conversation that had sprung up on the rights of women there were certain questions as to the inequality of rights in marriage improper to discuss before the ladies .
When the prince and the princess had gone , Levin went up to his betrothed and took her hand .
One was the renunciation of his old life , of his utterly useless education .
The close @-@ packed hay did not once break away off her fork .
&quot; I angry !
&quot; Oh no , oh no !
And for all that , at the same point in her memories , the feeling of shame was intensified , as though some inner voice , just at the point when she thought of Vronsky , were saying to her , &quot; Warm , very warm , hot . &quot; &quot; Well , what is it ? &quot; she said to herself resolutely , shifting her seat in the lounge .
Ah , I don &apos;t like that other world !
Vronsky satisfied all the mother &apos;s desires .
The old curly birches of the gardens , all their twigs laden with snow , looked as though freshly decked in sacred vestments .
&quot; Well ? &quot; he queried , smiling , and getting up .
&quot; I always said she was exquisite , your wife .
Ten years before , the old man had rented three hundred acres from the lady who owned them , and a year ago he had bought them and rented another three hundred from a neighboring landowner .
He was self @-@ possessed now and could speak , and he had a great deal he wanted to tell her .
Can sowing begin ? &quot; he asked , after a pause .
Varenka in her hat and with the parasol in her hands was sitting at the table examining the spring which Kitty had broken .
She &apos;s a very bad figure . &quot; &quot; Papa , it &apos;s not possible ! &quot; cried Kitty .
This trick , a bad habit , the cracking of his fingers , always soothed him , and gave precision to his thoughts , so needful to him at this juncture .
&quot; I won &apos;t and can &apos;t keep anything secret from you , &quot; she said .
Why should there not be some new force , still unknown to us , which .... &quot; &quot; When electricity was discovered , &quot; Levin interrupted hurriedly , &quot; it was only the phenomenon that was discovered , and it was unknown from what it proceeded and what were its effects , and ages passed before its applications were conceived .
Levin made no answer .
Low sports , such as prize @-@ fighting or Spanish bull @-@ fights , are a sign of barbarity .
Their uncle , Karenin , a government official of high standing , at one time a favorite of the late Tsar , had brought them up .
Her heart turned cold when she saw Kitty sitting on a low chair near the door , her eyes fixed immovably on a corner of the rug .
Vronsky had as a fact promised to call at Bryansky &apos;s , some eight miles from Peterhof , and to bring him some money owing for some horses ; and he hoped to have time to get that in too .
&quot; He &apos;s right that our system , that &apos;s to say of rational farming , doesn &apos;t answer , that the only thing that answers is the money @-@ lender system , like that meek @-@ looking gentleman &apos;s , or else the very simplest .... Whose fault is it ? &quot; &quot; Our own , of course .
Such boredom , my dear , that one doesn &apos;t know what to do with oneself . &quot; &quot; How can you be bored , prince ?
Yes , there was nothing else in the dream , &quot; he said to himself .
&quot; What should it be , but your trouble ? &quot; &quot; I have no trouble . &quot; &quot; Nonsense , Kitty .
On learning from the porter &apos;s wife , who came out to them , that Mihailov saw visitors at his studio , but that at that moment he was in his lodging only a couple of steps off , they sent her to him with their cards , asking permission to see his picture .
Both were men respected for their character and their intelligence .
&quot; Marya Nikolaevna , you come this side , you do it , &quot; she added .
With all the condescension of an elder brother he sometimes explained to him the true import of things , but he derived little satisfaction from arguing with him because he got the better of him too easily .
The master , sure , does his best for himself !
The barking of dogs showed the carriage had reached the village , and all that was left was the empty fields all round , the village in front , and he himself isolated and apart from it all , wandering lonely along the deserted highroad .
The note was from Betsy .
She had not even a hope of being asked for it , because she was so successful in society that the idea would never occur to anyone that she had remained disengaged till now .
Swinging his scythe just as ever , and moving his feet in their big , plaited shoes with firm , little steps , he climbed slowly up the steep place , and though his breeches hanging out below his smock , and his whole frame trembled with effort , he did not miss one blade of grass or one mushroom on his way , and kept making jokes with the peasants and Levin .
I do my best , Konstantin Dmitrievitch , d &apos;ye see , as I would for my own father .
Leave it here , &quot; said he , smiling , as Levin would have come back to take his hat .
I beseech you , do it ! &quot; he said .
The Shtcherbatskys were continually asking me about you , as though I ought to know .
In the little group nearest to the bride were her two sisters : Dolly , and the other one , the self @-@ possessed beauty , Madame Lvova , who had just arrived from abroad .
When she saw once more those composed gestures , heard that shrill , childish , and sarcastic voice , her aversion for him extinguished her pity for him , and she felt only afraid , but at all costs she wanted to make clear her position .
&quot; Yes , I was of Kiev , &quot; Kritsky replied angrily , his face darkening .
As he listened to Petritsky &apos;s familiar stories in the familiar setting of the rooms he had spent the last three years in , Vronsky felt a delightful sense of coming back to the careless Petersburg life that he was used to .
Not to speak of supper , of preparing for bed , of considering what they were going to do , he could not even talk to his wife ; he was ashamed to .
He knew now the one thing of importance ; and that one thing was at first there , in the drawing @-@ room , and then began moving across and came to a standstill at the door .
&quot; Tomorrow . &quot; &quot; And I will go with you , can I ? &quot; she said .
That &apos;s what she has done , &quot; said he .
do you really think it &apos;s possible ?
And such a splendid old man I made friends with there !
And that &apos;s not all - twenty years ago he would have found in that literature traces of conflict with authorities , with the creeds of the ages ; he would have perceived from this conflict that there was something else ; but now he comes at once upon a literature in which the old creeds do not even furnish matter for discussion , but it is stated baldly that there is nothing else - evolution , natural selection , struggle for existence - and that &apos;s all .
And Agafea Mihalovna will give us that marvelous herb @-@ brandy .... &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch sat down at the table and began joking with Agafea Mihalovna , assuring her that it was long since he had tasted such a dinner and such a supper .
What did you come for ? &quot; said Levin .
I &apos;d better meet you on your own ground , and talk about your maiolica and engravings .
He could not think about it , because in picturing what would happen , he could not drive away the reflection that her death would at once remove all the difficulty of his position .
Looking into his kindly old eyes , Levin realized even something new in his happiness .
&quot; I told you not to sit passengers on the roof , &quot; said the little girl in English ; &quot; there , pick them up ! &quot; &quot; Everything &apos;s in confusion , &quot; thought Stepan Arkadyevitch ; &quot; there are the children running about by themselves . &quot; And going to the door , he called them .
Chapter 15 The streets were still empty .
&quot; They say that that &apos;s a difficult task , that nothing &apos;s amusing that isn &apos;t spiteful , &quot; he began with a smile .
&quot; Yes , there is something uncanny , devilish and fascinating in her , &quot; Kitty said to herself .
&quot; But it &apos;s awful , awful ! &quot; His head sank , and he was silent .
It makes me sick , sick to see it , and you &apos;ve gone on till you &apos;ve turned the poor wench &apos;s head .
that &apos;s it ! &quot; he said , and , at once picking up the pencil , he began rapidly drawing .
&quot; However often you see her , every day she &apos;s different .
Levin involuntarily thought with him of what it was that was happening to him now , but in spite of all his mental efforts to go along with him he saw by the expression of that calm , stern face that for the dying man all was growing clearer and clearer that was still as dark as ever for Levin .
&quot; Aha !
I , for instance , in her place could have felt no doubt .
&quot; Can it be he sees her ?
&quot; - May be reduced to the following : adultery of one of the married parties , and the detection in the fact of the guilty party by mutual agreement , and failing such agreement , accidental detection .
Alexey Alexandrovitch had not expected him that day , and was surprised at his visit , and still more so when the doctor questioned him very carefully about his health , listened to his breathing , and tapped at his liver .
&quot; Yes ; he writes that you are here , and that he thinks you might allow me to be of use to you , &quot; said Levin , and as he said it he became suddenly embarrassed , and , stopping abruptly , he walked on in silence by the wagonette , snapping off the buds of the lime trees and nibbling them .
She skated up to Mlle.
Levin was sitting beside his hostess at the tea table , and was obliged to keep up a conversation with her and her sister , who was sitting opposite him .
The district doctor , a talkative young medical student , who had just finished his studies , came to see her .
&quot; You didn &apos;t tell a man , who didn &apos;t care for you , that you loved him , did you ? &quot; &quot; Of course not ; I never said a word , but he knew it .
He had to get through at least two hours more .
You &apos;re in the right ; but I &apos;m going all the same . &quot; It was only just at parting that Nikolay kissed him , and said , looking with sudden strangeness and seriousness at his brother : &quot; Anyway , don &apos;t remember evil against me , Kostya ! &quot; and his voice quivered .
Her complete ownership of him was a continual joy to her .
&quot; Come , he &apos;s amusing , anyway , your _ skeleton _ , and not depressing , &quot; said Dolly , smiling .
&quot; Well , she loves my child , &quot; he thought , noticing the change of her face at the child &apos;s cry , &quot; my child : how can she hate me ? &quot; &quot; Dolly , one word more , &quot; he said , following her .
horrible ! &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch stood a few seconds alone , wiped his face , squared his chest , and walked out of the room .
She too had not slept all night , and had been expecting him all the morning .
Sixteen hours of the day must be occupied in some way , since they were living abroad in complete freedom , outside the conditions of social life which filled up time in Petersburg .
&quot; You ought not to give way to grief .
The proof that her behavior and Agafea Mihalovna &apos;s was not instinctive , animal , irrational , was that apart from the physical treatment , the relief of suffering , both Agafea Mihalovna and Kitty required for the dying man something else more important than the physical treatment , and something which had nothing in common with physical conditions .
&quot; No , I am no longer a district councilor .
Five minutes later the brothers met in the dining @-@ room .
Then I &apos;ll come and see you , if your wife is nice . &quot; &quot; But come to me now , &quot; said Levin .
This was a lofty , mysterious religion connected with a whole series of noble thoughts and feelings , which one could do more than merely believe because one was told to , which one could love .
The fuss and bustle were disturbing ; then when the train had started , she could not help listening to the noises ; then the snow beating on the left window and sticking to the pane , and the sight of the muffled guard passing by , covered with snow on one side , and the conversations about the terrible snowstorm raging outside , distracted her attention .
With her long @-@ sighted eyes , she knew him at once , and was even aware that he was looking at her .
He had only not to refuse things , not to show jealousy , not to be quarrelsome or take offense , all of which from his characteristic good nature he never did .
And in her simple words there seemed to Alexey Alexandrovitch an allusion to his position .
To the carriage , instead of the restive Raven , they had harnessed , thanks to the representations of Marya Philimonovna , the bailiff &apos;s horse , Brownie , and Darya Alexandrovna , delayed by anxiety over her own attire , came out and got in , dressed in a white muslin gown .
He was making a sketch for the figure of a man in a violent rage .
&quot; That ought to form a brief introduction , which I thought unnecessary before . &quot; He got up to go to his writing @-@ table , and Laska , lying at his feet , got up too , stretching and looking at him as though to inquire where to go .
This agony of embarrassment was due to the fact that the sister @-@ in @-@ law was sitting opposite to him , in a dress , specially put on , as he fancied , for his benefit , cut particularly open , in the shape of a trapeze , on her white bosom .
The next rows were easier , but still Levin had to strain every nerve not to drop behind the peasants .
But in every gesture of Madame Stahl , in every word , in every heavenly - as Kitty called it - look , and above all in the whole story of her life , which she heard from Varenka , Kitty recognized that something &quot; that was important , &quot; of which , till then , she had known nothing .
In the mother &apos;s eyes there could be no comparison between Vronsky and Levin .
&quot; Of course .
Eh ?
She quickened her pace and rose smoothly , just as he had fancied she would , and as she left the ground gave herself up to the force of her rush , which carried her far beyond the ditch ; and with the same rhythm , without effort , with the same leg forward , Frou @-@ Frou fell back into her pace again .
&quot; Well , what do you mean to say , then ? &quot; &quot; I simply mean to say that those rights that touch me ... my interest , I shall always defend to the best of my ability ; that when they made raids on us students , and the police read our letters , I was ready to defend those rights to the utmost , to defend my rights to education and freedom .
I believe you &apos;re envious . &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve got over that , Darya Dmitrievna , &quot; he answered , and a melancholy and serious expression suddenly came over his face .
He reached Bryansky &apos;s , spent five minutes there , and galloped back .
But I cannot help feeling humiliated before other people for the position I am placed in .
&quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I know a gallant steed by tokens sure , And by his eyes I know a youth in love , &quot; &quot; declaimed Stepan Arkadyevitch .
&quot; Kostya !
She stopped still close to him , touching him .
&quot; Let me have a kiss of your pretty face .
But Anna &apos;s aunt had through a common acquaintance insinuated that he had already compromised the girl , and that he was in honor bound to make her an offer .
There was evidently coming over him that revulsion that would make him look upon death as the goal of his desires , as happiness .
&quot; Good morning , &quot; he said , smiling to the boy , who had come up to greet him .
With rapid , bony fingers he unbuttoned his coat , revealing a shirt , bronze waistcoat buttons , and a watch chain , and quickly pulled out a fat old pocketbook .
He doesn &apos;t believe even in my love for my child , or he despises it ( just as he always used to ridicule it ) .
How splendid it is !
&quot; To the stables ! &quot; he said , and was just pulling out the letters to read them through , but he thought better of it , and put off reading them so as not to distract his attention before looking at the mare .
&quot; My dear , how glad I am you came .
The princess , seeing them , breathed quickly , and immediately began to cry and then immediately began to laugh , and with a vigorous step Levin had not expected , ran up to him , and hugging his head , kissed him , wetting his cheeks with her tears .
Every person in the house felt that there was no sense in their living together , and that the stray people brought together by chance in any inn had more in common with one another than they , the members of the family and household of the Oblonskys .
Was he so awfully hot ? &quot; he commented , laughing .
I know it &apos;s not the truth , but I can &apos;t drive away such thoughts .
Chapter 3 When she went into Kitty &apos;s little room , a pretty , pink little room , full of knick @-@ knacks in _ vieux saxe , _ as fresh , and pink , and white , and gay as Kitty herself had been two months ago , Dolly remembered how they had decorated the room the year before together , with what love and gaiety .
&quot; Take them , take these dreadful books ! &quot; she said , pushing away the notebooks lying before her on the table .
&quot; Oh , yes ; we &apos;ll bury the world under our caps !
He succeeded so well in persuading his brother , and in lending him money for the journey without irritating him , that he was satisfied with himself in that matter .
The simple @-@ hearted Ivan , the cowherd , seemed completely to grasp Levin &apos;s proposal - that he should with his family take a share of the profits of the cattle @-@ yard - and he was in complete sympathy with the plan .
Anna looked at her with drooping eyelids , and smiled , pressing her hand .
For the same reason as you . &quot; &quot; And , at a moment of such gravity for me , she only thinks of her being dull by herself , &quot; thought Levin .
&quot; The firmer the woman &apos;s footing in society , the worse it is .
&quot; If you only knew how you are hurting me .
&quot; I told you that I would not allow you to receive your lover in this house . &quot; &quot; I had to see him to .... &quot; She stopped , not finding a reason .
He felt vexed with his wife for not being anxious about this exquisite baby , and in this vexed humor he had no wish to go to her ; he had no wish , either , to see Princess Betsy .
He laughed gaily , showing his even teeth , and pulling his cap over the thin place , went out and got into his carriage .
&quot; Are you always in the country ? &quot; he inquired .
Stepan Arkadyevitch went hurriedly up to Alexey Alexandrovitch and offered him a cigar .
If he were to kill me , if he were to kill Vronsky , I might respect him .
Everyone knew that he must inevitably die soon , that he was half dead already .
&quot; And so , &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself , &quot; questions as to her feelings , and so on , are questions for her conscience , with which I can have nothing to do .
Sergey Ivanovitch smiled .
Tomorrow .... &quot; he was beginning .
Chapter 21 &quot; We &apos;ve come to fetch you .
&quot; I &apos;ve come to bring you some money , too , for nightingales , we know , can &apos;t live on fairy tales , &quot; he said .
He was saying : &quot; Danger in the races of officers , of cavalry men , is an essential element in the race .
Golenishtchev never let slip an opportunity of instilling sound ideas about art into Mihailov .
It was as impossible as beating a woman , stealing , or lying .
&quot; I ought to see Alexey &quot; ( so she called Vronsky in her thoughts ) ; &quot; no one but he can tell me what I ought to do .
&quot; It &apos;s both , &quot; he said resolutely : &quot; I don &apos;t see that it was possible .... &quot; &quot; What !
Towards the end of the race everyone was in a state of agitation , which was intensified by the fact that the Tsar was displeased .
However , if .... &quot; &quot; But I &apos;ve said so already , so why repeat it ? &quot; Anna suddenly interrupted him with an irritation she could not succeed in repressing .
&quot; Give me a cup of tea , &quot; she said , standing at her table .
Yes , she will tell me directly what she told me before ; that there is no foundation for my suspicions , that it &apos;s absurd . &quot; At that moment , when the revelation of everything was hanging over him , there was nothing he expected so much as that she would answer mockingly as before that his suspicions were absurd and utterly groundless .
He dreaded the breaking up of the inward peace he had gained with such effort .
Still less could he have believed that he ought to marry .
Her eyes glowed with the fire he knew so well ; with a rapid movement she raised her lovely hands , covered with rings , took his head , looked a long look into his face , and , putting up her face with smiling , parted lips , swiftly kissed his mouth and both eyes , and pushed him away .
It &apos;s very stupid , but it &apos;ll pass off , &quot; said Anna quickly , and she bent her flushed face over a tiny bag in which she was packing a nightcap and some cambric handkerchiefs .
&quot; Yes , there &apos;s something humbugging , diplomatic in his face , &quot; and feeling he was blushing , he looked Stepan Arkadyevitch straight in the face without speaking .
&quot; I got it , and I really can &apos;t make out what _ you _ are worrying yourself about , &quot; said Alexey .
Alexey Alexandrovitch flung the telegram down , and flushing a little , got up and began to pace up and down the room .
Five minutes later there came in a friend of Kitty &apos;s , married the preceding winter , Countess Nordston .
If her features were criticized separately , she was handsome rather than plain , in spite of the sickly hue of her face .
&quot; To see her once and then to bury myself , to die , &quot; he thought , and as he was paying farewell visits , he uttered this thought to Betsy .
&quot; It cannot be that that fearful body was my brother Nikolay ? &quot; thought Levin .
He smiled at the question .
&quot; They &apos;ve just come ; they &apos;re unpacking the things . &quot; &quot; Come quickly , &quot; she said to him as she went out of the study , &quot; or else I shall read your letters without you . &quot; Left alone , after putting his manuscripts together in the new portfolio bought by her , he washed his hands at the new washstand with the elegant fittings , that had all made their appearance with her .
&quot; Yes , she won &apos;t forgive me , and she can &apos;t forgive me .
Towards the end of February it happened that Anna &apos;s baby daughter , who had been named Anna too , fell ill . Alexey Alexandrovitch was in the nursery in the morning , and leaving orders for the doctor to be sent for , he went to his office .
&quot; I have never seen it , but I know , mamma has told me , there are prayers said for recovery . &quot; &quot; Do you suppose he can possibly recover ? &quot; said Levin , watching a slender tress at the back of her round little head that was continually hidden when she passed the comb through the front .
Education : worse . &quot; &quot; But how do schools help matters ? &quot; &quot; They give the peasant fresh wants . &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s a thing I &apos;ve never understood , &quot; Levin replied with heat .
I &apos;m not Stiva , &quot; she said , knitting her brows .
Vronsky drove to the French theater , where he really had to see the colonel of his regiment , who never missed a single performance there .
And he felt still more frightened when , kissing him , he felt with his lips the dryness of his brother &apos;s skin and saw close to him his big eyes , full of a strange light .
&quot; For God &apos;s sake , let me finish ! &quot; he added , his eyes imploring her to give him time to explain his words .
His back teeth were beginning to decay .
&quot; Come to me in the next _ entr &apos;acte . _ &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t ; I &apos;m going to the French theater . &quot; &quot; From Nilsson ? &quot; Betsy queried in horror , though she could not herself have distinguished Nilsson &apos;s voice from any chorus girl &apos;s .
He loathes the sight of anything that &apos;s not after his fashion .
Chapter 5 After lunch Levin was not in the same place in the string of mowers as before , but stood between the old man who had accosted him jocosely , and now invited him to be his neighbor , and a young peasant , who had only been married in the autumn , and who was mowing this summer for the first time .
But however fast they worked , they did not spoil the grass , and the rows were laid just as neatly and exactly .
Having once taken the subject up , he read conscientiously everything bearing on it , and intended in the autumn to go abroad to study land systems on the spot , in order that he might not on this question be confronted with what so often met him on various subjects .
Haven &apos;t you noticed it ? &quot; &quot; No , my dear , for me there are no balls now where one enjoys oneself , &quot; said Anna , and Kitty detected in her eyes that mysterious world which was not open to her .
Don &apos;t insist !
He sighed as after a danger escaped when she uttered these words .
&quot; I don &apos;t know ; I have never tried for long .
He .... Are you ... with your wife ? &quot; Levin did not for the first moment understand what it was confused her , but she immediately enlightened him .
Every minute of Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s life was portioned out and occupied .
What was the dreadful thing I dreamed ?
&quot; And what does she talk French with the children for ? &quot; he thought ; &quot; how unnatural and false it is !
Darya Alexandrovna would not have let things go so far on such a day had she been present ; but she had to support the English governess &apos;s authority , and she upheld her decision that Grisha should have no tart .
Why , what for ? &quot; &quot; Oh , she was a horrid woman !
And you , Dolly ? &quot; Dolly stood beside them ; she heard them , but she did not answer .
Well ? &quot; &quot; They ring .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand it . &quot; Kitty &apos;s lower lip began to quiver ; she got up quickly .
Terrible as his brother Nikolay had been before in his emaciation and sickliness , now he looked still more emaciated , still more wasted .
&quot; Kostya !
The English governess , who had during Anna &apos;s illness replaced the French one , was sitting near the boy knitting a shawl .
Vronsky took the letter and his brother &apos;s note .
Tell me what you &apos;re doing , &quot; he went on , greedily munching a piece of bread , and pouring out another glassful .
&quot; Well , I rely on you , then , &quot; he said to the Englishman ; &quot; half @-@ past six on the ground . &quot; &quot; All right , &quot; said the Englishman .
But Alexey Alexandrovitch said nothing , and therefore the lawyer went on : &quot; The most usual and simple , the sensible course , I consider , is adultery by mutual consent .
I am like that sometimes .
Or your child will ask you : &quot; What awaits me in the life beyond the tomb ? &quot; What will you say to him when you know nothing ?
You can &apos;t imagine what you &apos;ve done for me by what you said .
how is he ? &quot; &quot; Very bad .
&quot; All together , &quot; said Anna , and she ran laughing to meet them , and embraced and swung round all the throng of swarming children , shrieking with delight .
is he doing all right ? &quot; he inquired , looking out of the window at the middle one of the three horses , which he had sold Vronsky .
&quot; Who ? &quot; she asked herself .
The petitioner , the widow of a staff captain Kalinin , came with a request impossible and unreasonable ; but Stepan Arkadyevitch , as he generally did , made her sit down , heard her to the end attentively without interrupting her , and gave her detailed advice as to how and to whom to apply , and even wrote her , in his large , sprawling , good and legible hand , a confident and fluent little note to a personage who might be of use to her .
&quot; Well , is it over ? &quot; &quot; It is over , &quot; answered Vronsky , smiling with his eyes only , and twirling the tips of his mustaches as circumspectly as though after the perfect order into which his affairs had been brought any over @-@ bold or rapid movement might disturb it .
Prince Kuzovlev sat with a white face on his thoroughbred mare from the Grabovsky stud , while an English groom led her by the bridle .
He raised his hat and would have driven on , but Stepan Arkadyevitch told his coachman to stop , and ran across the snow to him .
Eh ? &quot; Dolly could scarcely suppress a smile .
Nothing can spoil it ! &quot; He glanced at Kitty , and noticed that she was not in the least , not in the very least , disturbed by the idea of the trousseau .
The English fashion of the complete independence of girls was also not accepted , and not possible in Russian society .
A she @-@ bear ?
Chapter 17 Next day at eleven o &apos;clock in the morning Vronsky drove to the station of the Petersburg railway to meet his mother , and the first person he came across on the great flight of steps was Oblonsky , who was expecting his sister by the same train .
Stiva ! &quot; she cried to her brother .
princess !
&quot; The question of her feelings , of what has passed and may be passing in her soul , that &apos;s not my affair ; that &apos;s the affair of her conscience , and falls under the head of religion , &quot; he said to himself , feeling consolation in the sense that he had found to which division of regulating principles this new circumstance could be properly referred .
He had expected himself to feel the same distress at the loss of the brother he loved and the same horror in face of death as he had felt then , only in a greater degree .
&quot; The chief problem of the philosophy of all ages consists just in finding the indispensable connection which exists between individual and social interests .
Still , he took the sketch , laid it on his table , and , moving a little away , screwing up his eyes , he fell to gazing at it .
I won &apos;t stand up for my view , &quot; answered Levin , with a guilty , childlike smile .
Arriving for dinner at the village , and leaving his horse at the cottage of an old friend of his , the husband of his brother &apos;s wet @-@ nurse , Levin went to see the old man in his bee @-@ house , wanting to find out from him the truth about the hay .
&quot; Golenishtchev ! &quot; &quot; Vronsky ! &quot; It really was Golenishtchev , a comrade of Vronsky &apos;s in the Corps of Pages .
She hurriedly got up , curtseyed , and pulled Seryozha .
His great eyes , fastened on the holy image that was set out on a card @-@ table covered with a colored napkin , expressed such passionate prayer and hope that it was awful to Levin to see it .
All this I hope to discuss more in detail in a personal interview .
They say it &apos;s a marriage for love . &quot; &quot; For love ?
All this was falsehood , disgusting , irreverent deceit .
But the end did not come .
&quot; In another world we shall understand it all , &quot; he said lightly .
But what sort of a man was he ?
He had two pieces of business before him that morning ; first , to receive and send on a deputation from the native tribes which was on its way to Petersburg , and now at Moscow ; secondly , to write the promised letter to the lawyer .
&quot; I must tell you about that .
&quot; Club ?
And will find them , in all probability . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s just what I was meaning , &quot; answered Levin .
He did not believe a single word Stepan Arkadyevitch said to him ; to every word he had a thousand objections to make , but he listened to him , feeling that his words were the expression of that mighty brutal force which controlled his life and to which he would have to submit .
And the consciousness of this unnaturalness , and the remorse he felt at it , made him even more unnatural .
He turned round .
The old man , holding himself erect , moved in front , with his feet turned out , taking long , regular strides , and with a precise and regular action which seemed to cost him no more effort than swinging one &apos;s arms in walking , as though it were in play , he laid down the high , even row of grass .
&quot; Kitty , mind you &apos;re the first to step on the carpet , &quot; said Countess Nordston , coming up .
His ideas of marriage were , consequently , quite unlike those of the great majority of his acquaintances , for whom getting married was one of the numerous facts of social life .
I know how painful it was , &quot; he said .
Of his women friends , foremost amongst them Countess Lidia Ivanovna , Alexey Alexandrovitch never thought .
Nikolay Dmitrievitch &apos;s health has become very poor .
&quot; They say it &apos;s ten years since she has stood on her feet . &quot; &quot; She doesn &apos;t stand up because her legs are too short .
As he went into the entry , Alexey Alexandrovitch , as it were , got out his resolution from the remotest corner of his brain , and mastered it thoroughly .
&quot; That is from every point of view the most rational course for married people who find themselves in the position you are in .
He turned , and without picking up his cap that had fallen off , walked away from the race course , not knowing where he was going .
He liked and did not like the peasants , just as he liked and did not like men in general .
&quot; The servant of God , Konstantin , plights his troth to the servant of God , Ekaterina . &quot; And putting his big ring on Kitty &apos;s touchingly weak , pink little finger , the priest said the same thing .
&quot; No !
&quot; I &apos;ll tell you what interests me very much , &quot; said Levin .
Stay a little longer , &quot; he said to Varenka .
The unfathomable eyes gazed ironically and insolently at him .
The Shtcherbatskys &quot; hall @-@ porter certainly knew all about it .
He says he &apos;s going to take her home to his country place at once .
&quot; I am afraid that you must have been dreadfully bored , &quot; he said , promptly catching the ball of coquetry she had flung him .
&quot; A waltz , Anna Arkadyevna ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t dance when it &apos;s possible not to dance , &quot; she said .
Today , with Levin &apos;s reappearance , a fresh source of anxiety arose .
&quot; No ; if things are to go on like this , the end will come much , much too soon . &quot; &quot; What is it , dear one ? &quot; &quot; What ?
&quot; Yes , I shall certainly go , &quot; replied Levin ; &quot; though I fancied the princess was not very warm in her invitation . &quot; &quot; What nonsense !
She remembered Vronsky .
&quot; Ignat ! &quot; he called to the coachman , who , with his sleeves tucked up , was washing the carriage wheels , &quot; saddle me .... &quot; &quot; Which , sir ? &quot; &quot; Well , let it be Kolpik . &quot; &quot; Yes , sir . &quot; While they were saddling his horse , Levin again called up the bailiff , who was hanging about in sight , to make it up with him , and began talking to him about the spring operations before them , and his plans for the farm .
&quot; And I have confidence in myself when you are leaning on me , &quot; he said , but was at once panic @-@ stricken at what he had said , and blushed .
Pava , a perfect beauty , huge as a hippopotamus , with her back turned to them , prevented their seeing the calf , as she sniffed her all over .
The mornings they spent driving to look at places of interest ; the evenings they passed enjoying the national entertainments .
She especially .... &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t believe a word of what &apos;s said about her , &quot; said Anna quickly .
I , the innocent person , should be the victim - killed or wounded .
Yes , Sir John ; I &apos;ve seen him .
But there was a gleam of alarm in Sviazhsky &apos;s eyes , and he said smiling : &quot; No ; that screaming story is positively capital !
&quot; But here they are . &quot; Chapter 18 They heard the sound of steps and a man &apos;s voice , then a woman &apos;s voice and laughter , and immediately thereafter there walked in the expected guests : Sappho Shtoltz , and a young man beaming with excess of health , the so @-@ called Vaska .
&quot; My duty is clearly marked for me ; I ought to be with her , and I will be .
You are altogether , as the French say , too _ primesautière _ a nature ; you must have intense , energetic action , or nothing . &quot; Levin listened to his brother and did not understand a single word , and did not want to understand .
He says , too , that education may be the consequence of greater prosperity and comfort , of more frequent washing , as he says , but not of being able to read and write .... &quot; &quot; Well , then , I &apos;m very glad - or the contrary , very sorry , that I &apos;m in agreement with Spencer ; only I &apos;ve known it a long while .
&quot; We &apos;ll talk it over .
In Switzerland he had killed chamois .
The other side ! &quot; she said angrily to Varenka , who had rearranged the rug over her feet not to her satisfaction .
And with all this , Stepan Arkadyevitch , who liked a joke , was fond of puzzling a plain man by saying that if he prided himself on his origin , he ought not to stop at Rurik and disown the first founder of his family - the monkey .
&quot; So now we are to have it out , &quot; she thought , and she felt frightened .
And he was surprised that she , his poetic , exquisite Kitty , could , not merely in the first weeks , but even in the first days of their married life , think , remember , and busy herself about tablecloths , and furniture , about mattresses for visitors , about a tray , about the cook , and the dinner , and so on .
What will become of her , if you cast her off ? &quot; &quot; I have thought , Darya Alexandrovna , I have thought a great deal , &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch .
&quot; At our last conversation , I notified you of my intention to communicate to you my decision in regard to the subject of that conversation .
Sergey Ivanovitch watched him with a smile .
Keep him with him ?
&quot; Can it be that they won &apos;t forgive me , won &apos;t understand how it all couldn &apos;t be helped ? &quot; she said to herself .
&quot; Come , maman , let us go . &quot; Madame Karenina entered the carriage again to say good @-@ bye to the countess .
The answers were all based on official data furnished by governors and heads of churches , and founded on the reports of district magistrates and ecclesiastical superintendents , founded in their turn on the reports of parochial overseers and parish priests ; and so all of these answers were unhesitating and certain .
She understood because she was all the while mentally keeping watch on what he needed .
He sent the saddle without an answer , and with a sense of having done something shameful ; he handed over all the now revolting business of the estate to the bailiff , and set off next day to a remote district to see his friend Sviazhsky , who had splendid marshes for grouse in his neighborhood , and had lately written to ask him to keep a long @-@ standing promise to stay with him .
&quot; I shall find out for certain whether she &apos;s married , or when she &apos;s going to be married , &quot; he thought .
&quot; Allow me to make your acquaintance , &quot; she said , with her dignified smile .
When she mused on the past , she dwelt with pleasure , with tenderness , on the memories of her relations with Levin .
How I feel that we might have been friends ! &quot; she said ; and , distressed at what she had said , she looked round at her husband , and tears came into her eyes .
Her bare shoulders and arms gave Kitty a sense of chill marble , a feeling she particularly liked .
The principal qualities in Stepan Arkadyevitch which had gained him this universal respect in the service consisted , in the first place , of his extreme indulgence for others , founded on a consciousness of his own shortcomings ; secondly , of his perfect liberalism - not the liberalism he read of in the papers , but the liberalism that was in his blood , in virtue of which he treated all men perfectly equally and exactly the same , whatever their fortune or calling might be ; and thirdly - the most important point - his complete indifference to the business in which he was engaged , in consequence of which he was never carried away , and never made mistakes .
&quot; It &apos;s late , it &apos;s late , &quot; she whispered with a smile .
His excitement , his delight , and his tenderness for Frou @-@ Frou grew keener and keener .
Levin did not notice how time was passing .
&quot; But this was just what I wanted , to find you alone , &quot; he began , not sitting down , and not looking at her , so as not to lose courage .
He was thinking of his own affairs , and did not hear Oblonsky .
So long as there &apos;s health , and my health , thank God , is quite restored . &quot; Levin listened and racked his brains , but could think of nothing to say .
And he had now come to Moscow with a firm determination to make an offer , and get married if he were accepted .
Anna spent the whole morning with Dolly and the children .
So please come round to dinner .
I have had to do business with him , &quot; positively and conclusively . &quot; &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed .
Oh , take these cloaks off me ! &quot; The doctor unloosed her hands , carefully laying her on the pillow , and covered her up to the shoulders .
&quot; It &apos;s impossible , impossible .... &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so glad you think so , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , shaking his head with a serious and sympathetically distressed expression , &quot; that &apos;s what I &apos;ve come to Petersburg for . &quot; &quot; The whole town &apos;s talking of it , &quot; she said .
&quot; I observe .... &quot; &quot; Eh ?
Hopelessly ill as he was , obvious as it was at the first glance that he could not recover , Levin and Kitty were for that hour both in the same state of excitement , happy , though fearful of being mistaken .
The priest waited a few seconds to see if he would not say more , and closing his eyes he said quickly , with a broad , Vladimirsky accent : &quot; Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind , but we must pray that God in His mercy will strengthen us .
I assure you I have reckoned it all out , &quot; he said , &quot; and the forest is fetching a very good price - so much so that I &apos;m afraid of this fellow &apos;s crying off , in fact .
&quot; My colleagues : Philip Ivanitch Nikitin , Mihail Stanislavitch Grinevitch &quot; - and turning to Levin - &quot; a district councilor , a modern district councilman , a gymnast who lifts thirteen stone with one hand , a cattle @-@ breeder and sportsman , and my friend , Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin , the brother of Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev . &quot; &quot; Delighted , &quot; said the veteran .
&quot; No ; you laugh , &quot; said Anna , laughing too in spite of herself , &quot; but I never could understand it .
Smiling and showing her false teeth , she greeted him as an old friend .
&quot; Here it is ! &quot; said Levin , pointing to Laska , who with one ear raised , wagging the end of her shaggy tail , came slowly back as though she would prolong the pleasure , and as it were smiling , brought the dead bird to her master .
But he &apos;s more than simply a good @-@ natured fellow , as I &apos;ve found out here - he &apos;s a cultivated man , too , and very intelligent ; he &apos;s a man who &apos;ll make his mark . &quot; Levin scowled and was dumb .
Alexey Alexandrovitch , frowning , got up , and disengaging his hand , moved her a chair .
&quot; No , it was my fancy , &quot; she thought , recalling the expression of his face when he stumbled over the word &quot; suffering . &quot; &quot; No ; can a man with those dull eyes , with that self @-@ satisfied complacency , feel anything ? &quot; &quot; I cannot change anything , &quot; she whispered .
When he had finished his letters , Stepan Arkadyevitch moved the office @-@ papers close to him , rapidly looked through two pieces of business , made a few notes with a big pencil , and pushing away the papers , turned to his coffee .
It is true that the peasants of the same company , though they had agreed to work the land on new conditions , always spoke of the land , not as held in partnership , but as rented for half the crop , and more than once the peasants and Ryezunov himself said to Levin , &quot; If you would take a rent for the land , it would save you trouble , and we should be more free . &quot; Moreover the same peasants kept putting off , on various excuses , the building of a cattleyard and barn on the land as agreed upon , and delayed doing it till the winter .
&quot; Not the slightest !
&quot; Ah , what am I doing ! &quot; she said to herself , feeling a sudden thrill of pain in both sides of her head .
Engage a piano player , and let them dance , and not as you do things nowadays , hunting up good matches .
But you don &apos;t understand such things . &quot; &quot; Oh , do show me !
I &apos;m forced to go on to old Madame Vrede .
He walked across her boudoir to the bedroom door , and turned back again .
He was very well aware that in their eyes the position of an unsuccessful lover of a girl , or of any woman free to marry , might be ridiculous .
He felt now that he was not simply close to her , but that he did not know where he ended and she began .
&quot; I don &apos;t believe it , &quot; Sviazhsky replied quite seriously ; &quot; all I see is that we don &apos;t know how to cultivate the land , and that our system of agriculture in the serf days was by no means too high , but too low .
Now , whether for good or for ill , Levin could not choose but remain ; he must find out what the man was like whom she loved .
&quot; Once more I offer you my arm if you want to be going , &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch , reaching towards her hand .
His eyes I ought to know - Seryozha has just the same eyes - and I can &apos;t bear to see them because of it .
You would be a hindrance to me , &quot; said Levin , trying to be cool .
I was thinking about Moscow , about the back of your head . &quot; &quot; Why should I , of all people , have such happiness !
&quot; Prince Alexander Shtcherbatsky , &quot; said Madame Stahl , lifting upon him her heavenly eyes , in which Kitty discerned a look of annoyance .
I have to start tomorrow . &quot; Darya Alexandrovna was firmly convinced of Anna &apos;s innocence , and she felt herself growing pale and her lips quivering with anger at this frigid , unfeeling man , who was so calmly intending to ruin her innocent friend .
And since no difference is less easily overcome than the difference of opinion about semi @-@ abstract questions , they never agreed in any opinion , and had long , indeed , been accustomed to jeer without anger , each at the other &apos;s incorrigible aberrations .
&quot; Wait a bit !
How can we be reconciled ?
In that direction gazed the young men , not venturing to approach .
Although he happened to be bubbling over with good spirits , Stepan Arkadyevitch immediately and quite naturally fell into the sympathetic , poetically emotional tone which harmonized with her mood .
But I know no peace , and I can &apos;t give it to you ; all myself - and love ... yes .
&quot; Who &apos;s _ I _ ? &quot; Nikolay &apos;s voice said again , still more angrily .
&quot; I can &apos;t help it if they don &apos;t like it .
The dressmaker came to explain , declaring that it would be better as she had done it , and Anna was so furious that she felt ashamed when she thought of it afterwards .
Kitty gazed in admiration at Anna waltzing , and listened to him .
That was the only thing he disliked , and avoided by changing the conversation to something agreeable and amusing .
When the case had been read through , Stepan Arkadyevitch got up and stretched , and by way of tribute to the liberalism of the times took out a cigarette in the boardroom and went into his private room .
&quot; Is Seryozha quite well ? &quot; she asked .
Frocks were made or altered and washed , seams and flounces were let out , buttons were sewn on , and ribbons got ready .
&quot; For the third time I offer you my arm , &quot; he said to her after a little time , turning to her .
&quot; I consider , on the contrary , that the two questions are inseparably connected together , &quot; said Pestsov ; &quot; it is a vicious circle .
&quot; Except you , there &apos;s none of the gentlemen first @-@ rate skaters .
Chapter 13 After dinner , and till the beginning of the evening , Kitty was feeling a sensation akin to the sensation of a young man before a battle .
Only he could not make up his mind whether it was unintelligible because he was not capable of expressing his meaning clearly , or because his brother would not or could not understand him .
She foretold , for instance , that Princess Shahovskaya would marry Brenteln .
And it was so strange to see this sensible , manly face in such a childish plight , that Oblonsky left off looking at him .
I &apos;m so glad ! &quot; &quot; But you &apos;re ill or worried , &quot; he went on , not letting go her hands and bending over her .
She asked Annushka to hand her the cape she had taken off and her shawl , put them on and moved towards the door .
The herd of improved cows such as Pava , the whole land ploughed over and enriched , the nine level fields surrounded with hedges , the two hundred and forty acres heavily manured , the seed sown in drills , and all the rest of it - it was all splendid if only the work had been done for themselves , or for themselves and comrades - people in sympathy with them .
Yes , &quot; he said , smiling to him as tenderly as a woman , &quot; give me _ carte blanche _ , retire from the regiment , and I &apos;ll draw you upwards imperceptibly . &quot; &quot; But you must understand that I want nothing , &quot; said Vronsky , &quot; except that all should be as it is . &quot; Serpuhovskoy got up and stood facing him .
Ever since his brother &apos;s arrival , he had been in doubt whether to mow or not .
But an hour passed ; he did not come .
&quot; You must ask the doctor to examine the wet @-@ nurse , &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch .
Nothing special happened at the ceremony of benediction with the holy picture .
I am not a spiteful man , I have never hated anyone , but I hate her with my whole soul , and I cannot even forgive her , because I hate her too much for all the wrong she has done me ! &quot; he said , with tones of hatred in his voice .
Come along , please , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , pointing in the direction of the dining @-@ room .
&quot; Come , we &apos;ll go to the counting house , if you have to go there . &quot; &quot; Oh , heavens ! &quot; shouted Levin , so loudly that Sergey Ivanovitch was quite frightened .
&quot; Have you been long with my brother ? &quot; he said to her .
&quot; Oh , these farmers ! &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch playfully .
With Pestsov intellectual conversation never flagged for an instant .
You say that our position is miserable , that we must put an end to it .
Then he gave them the candles , and taking the censer , moved slowly away from them .
It was obviously difficult for him to think of what to say and do .
Relations with the society of the place - foreign and Russian - were equally out of the question owing to the irregularity of their position .
Here somewhere about . &quot; &quot; Come , enough fooling !
Here it is , yes , it is .
There was something awful and revolting in the memory of what had been bought at this fearful price of shame .
&quot; Won &apos;t you sit down , countess ?
He stretched out his legs again and flung himself on the sofa in the same position and shut his eyes .
They said that there was no denying his talent , but that his talent could not develop for want of education - the common defect of our Russian artists .
To Konstantin Levin the country was the background of life , that is of pleasures , endeavors , labor .
To my mind , love ... both the sorts of love , which you remember Plato defines in his Banquet , served as the test of men .
He makes the horses ill with too much water , cuts good harness , barters the tires of the wheels for drink , drops bits of iron into the thrashing machine , so as to break it .
&quot; You would not be open with me , &quot; he seemed to say , mentally addressing her ; &quot; so much the worse for you .
But she was mistaken in thinking he realized the gravity of the fact as she , a woman , realized it .
He saw that instead of doing as he had intended - that is to say , warning his wife against a mistake in the eyes of the world - he had unconsciously become agitated over what was the affair of her conscience , and was struggling against the barrier he fancied between them .
And it seemed to him that the problem could be solved , and that he ought to try and solve it .
Levin got on his horse and , parting regretfully from the peasants , rode homewards .
&quot; It &apos;s very flattering for me , countess , that you remember my words so well , &quot; responded Levin , who had succeeded in recovering his composure , and at once from habit dropped into his tone of joking hostility to the Countess Nordston .
That &apos;s first @-@ rate , for I sent my carriage home . &quot; The friends hardly spoke all the way .
Chapter 34 Before the end of the course of drinking the waters , Prince Shtcherbatsky , who had gone on from Carlsbad to Baden and Kissingen to Russian friends - to get a breath of Russian air , as he said - came back to his wife and daughter .
There were at the time as many reasons for the step as against it , and there was no overbalancing consideration to outweigh his invariable rule of abstaining when in doubt .
The day of the races had been a very busy day for Alexey Alexandrovitch ; but when mentally sketching out the day in the morning , he made up his mind to go to their country house to see his wife immediately after dinner , and from there to the races , which all the Court were to witness , and at which he was bound to be present .
It was Kitty .
&quot; Delighted , &quot; he said coldly .
Would you like some champagne ?
He did not cough once in the course of an hour , smiled , kissed Kitty &apos;s hand , thanking her with tears , and said he was comfortable , free from pain , and that he felt strong and had an appetite .
&quot; Now it &apos;s coming ! &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch &apos;s figure again went behind the bush , and Levin saw nothing but the bright flash of a match , followed by the red glow and blue smoke of a cigarette .
But she did not tell Kitty about the two hundred roubles .
&quot; Why , has he been here long ? &quot; the princess asked about Levin , as they returned home .
I &apos;ll come and look at her , &quot; he said to the bailiff .
And her life was not a cheerful one .
&quot; It &apos;s time , it &apos;s time , &quot; said he , with a meaning smile , and he went into their bedroom .
He saw already from her loving , truthful face , that nothing could come of what he had meant to say , but yet he wanted her to reassure him herself .
&quot; Come , I &apos;ll tell you how we &apos;ll manage : you drive in our carriage to fetch him , and Sergey Ivanovitch , if he &apos;ll be so good , will drive there and then send his carriage . &quot; &quot; Of course ; I shall be delighted . &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll come on directly with him .
I don &apos;t know the law , and so I don &apos;t know with which of the parents the son should remain ; but I take him with me because I cannot live without him .
They burst out laughing , and , with their mouths full of tart , they began wiping their smiling lips with their hands , and smearing their radiant faces all over with tears and jam .
Chapter 33 Alexey Alexandrovitch came back from the meeting of the ministers at four o &apos;clock , but as often happened , he had not time to come in to her .
&quot; Don &apos;t be afraid , don &apos;t be afraid , Darya Alexandrovna ! &quot; he said , smiling good @-@ humoredly to the mother ; &quot; there &apos;s no chance of my hurting or dropping her . &quot; And , looking at his strong , agile , assiduously careful and needlessly wary movements , the mother felt her mind at rest , and smiled gaily and approvingly as she watched him .
I should so like to see you at a ball . &quot; &quot; Anyway , if I do go , I shall comfort myself with the thought that it &apos;s a pleasure to you ... Grisha , don &apos;t pull my hair .
He had never met Anna before , and was struck by her beauty , and still more by the frankness with which she accepted her position .
&quot; And you must know they &apos;ve three children , no servant , and scarcely any means .
&quot; Can &apos;t help it .
&quot; I want to talk to you . &quot; &quot; What about ? &quot; Kitty asked swiftly , lifting her head in dismay .
Yes , yes , that &apos;s it ! &quot; Kitty repeated to herself with horror .
I must own I &apos;m very , very glad you came .
But allow me to ask what it consists in , that aristocracy of Vronsky or of anybody else , beside which I can be looked down upon ?
I am too proud ever to allow myself to care for a man who does not love me . &quot; &quot; Yes , I don &apos;t say so either .... Only one thing .
The wife is the hindrance . &quot; &quot; Why so ? &quot; &quot; Oh , you &apos;ll see !
&quot; I hope you are not angry with him ? &quot; &quot; No , not the least ! &quot; Nikolay answered , vexed at the question .
&quot; I &apos;ll begin from the beginning .
He maintained , with peculiar satisfaction , it seemed , that maiden modesty is a mere relic of barbarism , and that nothing could be more natural than for a man still youngish to handle a young girl naked .
&quot; What doubt can you have of the Creator when you behold His creation ? &quot; the priest went on in the rapid customary jargon .
&quot; Please , ask it . &quot; &quot; Here , &quot; he said ; and he wrote the initial letters , _ w , y , t , m , i , c , n , b , d , t , m , n , o , t _ .
&quot; Whose marshal you are . &quot; &quot; Yes , only I marshal them in the other direction , &quot; said Sviazhsky , laughing .
Well , the ... what &apos;s his name , whatever he was ... tries to take the helmet from him ... he won &apos;t give it up ! ...
&quot; Bill ! &quot; he called , and he went into the next room where he promptly came across an aide @-@ de @-@ camp of his acquaintance and dropped into conversation with him about an actress and her protector .
One can hear and see the grass growing ! &quot; Levin said to himself , noticing a wet , slate @-@ colored aspen leaf moving beside a blade of young grass .
The celebrated singer was singing for the second time , and all the fashionable world was in the theater .
In the high school and the university , and afterwards in the service , Alexey Alexandrovitch had never formed a close friendship with anyone .
On the journey in the train he talked to his neighbors about politics and the new railways , and , just as in Moscow , he was overcome by a sense of confusion of ideas , dissatisfaction with himself , shame of something or other .
Yes , I &apos;m _ awfully _ fond of turbot . &quot; Chapter 10 When Levin went into the restaurant with Oblonsky , he could not help noticing a certain peculiarity of expression , as it were , a restrained radiance , about the face and whole figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch .
And each time he glanced at her , he saw her eyes gazing at him with such passionate and triumphant tenderness as he had never seen in them .
But he did not display his knowledge except when he was compelled to do so .
After changing his clothes he went down to his brother &apos;s study , intending to talk to him at once about the object of his visit , and to ask his advice ; but his brother was not alone .
Only at intervals he listened in the stillness to the click of Agafea Mihalovna &apos;s needles , and recollecting what he did not want to remember , he frowned again .
Now , forgive me , everyone , forgive me ! ...
&quot; Yes , she was bound to choose him .
Anna walked into the drawing @-@ room .
&quot; I told them to bring the trap round ; or would you rather walk ? &quot; &quot; No , we &apos;d better drive , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , getting into the trap .
Am I not the wife of my husband ? &quot; &quot; There is a way out of every position .
Leave it to me .
On getting home he flew into a rage with his wife for not having managed to put off the landlady , who had been asking for money .
He had taken off his coat and put his sunburnt , hairy neck under the tap , and was rubbing it and his head with his hands .
&quot; I &apos;m going with Mihail Vassilievitch .
What do you think about it ? &quot; she turned to Anna , who , with a faintly perceptible resolute smile on her lips , was listening in silence to the conversation .
&quot; Let me introduce you , &quot; said the princess , indicating Levin .
&quot; I don &apos;t quite know myself .
But it was not so much from ill @-@ health as from pride - so Princess Shtcherbatskaya interpreted it - that Madame Stahl had not made the acquaintance of anyone among the Russians there .
&quot; Anna , I must warn you , &quot; he began .
The enthusiasm over this picture stirred some of the old feeling for it in Mihailov , but he feared and disliked this waste of feeling for things past , and so , even though this praise was grateful to him , he tried to draw his visitors away to a third picture .
He had eaten scarcely anything at dinner , had refused tea and supper at Sviazhsky &apos;s , but he was incapable of thinking of supper .
And indeed , Naples and Sorrento are only pleasant for a short time .
Moreover , she became aware of all the dreariness of the world of sorrow , of sick and dying people , in which she had been living .
&quot; I &apos;m worrying myself because the remark has just been made to me that you weren &apos;t here , and that you were seen in Peterhof on Monday . &quot; &quot; There are matters which only concern those directly interested in them , and the matter you are so worried about is .... &quot; &quot; Yes , but if so , you may as well cut the service .... &quot; &quot; I beg you not to meddle , and that &apos;s all I have to say . &quot; Alexey Vronsky &apos;s frowning face turned white , and his prominent lower jaw quivered , which happened rarely with him .
Sviazhsky was sitting sideways , with one elbow on the table , and a cup in one hand , while with the other hand he gathered up his beard , held it to his nose and let it drop again , as though he were smelling it .
Kitty glanced at her sister , and the cold , rather ill @-@ tempered expression of her face did not change .
No , I have no pride .
Those who lived near had gone home , while those who came from far were gathered into a group for supper , and to spend the night in the meadow .
There remained only one obstacle , the most difficult ; if he could cross it ahead of the others he would come in first .
&quot; I came to tell you .... &quot; he said .
And so all desires were merged in one - the desire to be rid of all his sufferings and their source , the body .
&quot; It was all the same before , of course ; but why was it I didn &apos;t notice it before ? &quot; Anna asked herself .
He &apos;ll kiss your hand , and all will end satisfactorily , &quot; answered Vronsky .
When the child at last was still , and had been put in a deep bed , and the nurse , after smoothing the little pillow , had left her , Alexey Alexandrovitch got up , and walking awkwardly on tiptoe , approached the baby .
&quot; Masha !
A roll will sometimes smell so good one can &apos;t resist it . &quot; &quot; Himmlisch ist &apos;s , wenn ich bezwungen Meine irdische Begier ; Aber doch wenn &apos;s nich gelungen Hatt &quot; ich auch recht hübsch Plaisir ! &quot; As he said this , Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled subtly .
If you don &apos;t succeed with them it only proves that you &apos;ve not enough cash , but in this case one &apos;s dignity &apos;s at stake .
But to Anna &apos;s taste Liza was far more attractive .
&quot; An excellent young lady . &quot; &quot; Yes , &quot; answered Levin , blushing for the priest .
But for the little newborn baby he felt a quite peculiar sentiment , not of pity , only , but of tenderness .
I &apos;ll go down to the kitchen , &quot; she brought out .
I have come to tell you that this must end .
&quot; I &apos;m going ; good @-@ bye ! &quot; said Anna , and kissing her son , she went up to Alexey Alexandrovitch and held out her hand to him .
That would be a pity .
Serpuhovskoy went into the house to the bathroom to wash his hands and found Vronsky there ; Vronsky was drenching his head with water .
Kitty had been seeing Anna every day ; she adored her , and had pictured her invariably in lilac .
I know it now . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s true , &quot; she said , getting whiter and whiter , and embracing his head .
&quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch , &quot; she said , with desperate resolution looking him in the face , &quot; I asked you about Anna , you made me no answer .
Such a discovery now would only mean breaking up family habits , and she let herself be deceived , despising him and still more herself , for the weakness .
God gave the day , God gave the strength .
&quot; I must get coats , you know , for Grisha and Tanya .
They &apos;ve come again ; why don &apos;t they go away ? ...
He was a very stupid and very self @-@ satisfied and very healthy and very well @-@ washed man , and nothing else .
I &apos;m glad to hear it , &quot; said Vronsky .
That velvet was delicious ; at home , looking at her neck in the looking @-@ glass , Kitty had felt that that velvet was speaking .
She gave him her hand , and they set off side by side , going faster and faster , and the more rapidly they moved the more tightly she grasped his hand .
He had already prepared the phrase : &quot; You have heard of my trouble ? &quot; But he ended by saying , as usual : &quot; So you &apos;ll get this ready for me ? &quot; and with that dismissed him .
&quot; I should say not .
Chapter 4 Alexey Alexandrovitch , after meeting Vronsky on his own steps , drove , as he had intended , to the Italian opera .
There was the warm , steamy smell of dung when the frozen door was opened , and the cows , astonished at the unfamiliar light of the lantern , stirred on the fresh straw .
She soothed her mistress , assured her that everything would _ come round _ ( it was her expression , and Matvey had borrowed it from her ) , and without fuss or hurry proceeded to set to work herself .
You are at this moment just in the humor to appreciate all its gravity .
But a girl &apos;s in a position of suspense , with all a woman &apos;s or maiden &apos;s modesty , a girl who sees you men from afar , who takes everything on trust , - a girl may have , and often has , such a feeling that she cannot tell what to say . &quot; &quot; Yes , if the heart does not speak .... &quot; &quot; No , the heart does speak ; but just consider : you men have views about a girl , you come to the house , you make friends , you criticize , you wait to see if you have found what you love , and then , when you are sure you love her , you make an offer .... &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s not quite it . &quot; &quot; Anyway you make an offer , when your love is ripe or when the balance has completely turned between the two you are choosing from .
Absorbed in business with the chief secretary , Alexey Alexandrovitch had completely forgotten that it was Tuesday , the day fixed by him for the return of Anna Arkadyevna , and he was surprised and received a shock of annoyance when a servant came in to inform him of her arrival .
It ought to be like the natural sciences , and to observe given phenomena and the laborer in his economic , ethnographical .... &quot; At that instant Agafea Mihalovna came in with jam .
You wouldn &apos;t believe how insufferable it &apos;s been for me . &quot; &quot; Why so ?
If you care to use that word , what is base is to forsake husband and child for a lover , while you eat your husband &apos;s bread ! &quot; She bowed her head .
He saw the first meeting between the husband and wife , and noted with a lover &apos;s insight the signs of slight reserve with which she spoke to her husband .
I dreamed that I ran into my bedroom , that I had to get something there , to find out something ; you know how it is in dreams , &quot; she said , her eyes wide with horror ; &quot; and in the bedroom , in the corner , stood something . &quot; &quot; Oh , what nonsense !
It answers with Vassiltchikov . &quot; &quot; A factory .... &quot; &quot; But I really don &apos;t know what it is you are surprised at .
I love you .
&quot; She will join him , and in a year or two he will throw her over , or she will form a new tie , &quot; thought Alexey Alexandrovitch .
Where have you been ?
And if she would not tell me , she would certainly not speak of it to anyone else .
And they themselves , in giving their opinion , said a great deal but never said what was their real object .
But there was another class of people , the real people .
&quot; Aren &apos;t you frightened , eh ? &quot; said Marya Dmitrievna , an old aunt .
Unconsciously he arched his chest , and his eyes flashed .
In the very first minute the close group of horsemen drew out , and it could be seen that they were approaching the stream in twos and threes and one behind another .
Well , everyone &apos;s winking at him , nodding , frowning - give it to her , do !
&quot; Tomorrow ; If you ask me , I should say , the benediction today and the wedding tomorrow . &quot; &quot; Come , _ mon cher _ , that &apos;s nonsense ! &quot; &quot; Well , in a week . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s quite mad . &quot; &quot; No , why so ? &quot; &quot; Well , upon my word ! &quot; said the mother , smiling , delighted at this haste .
The talks he had been having with the peasants in the further village had shown that they were beginning to get used to their new position .
Receive him .
Being a man of very warm heart , he was seldom angry ; but when he was angry , and when his chin quivered , then , as Alexander Vronsky knew , he was dangerous .
I took her out of a bad house , &quot; and he jerked his neck saying this ; &quot; but I love her and respect her , and anyone who wants to know me , &quot; he added , raising his voice and knitting his brows , &quot; I beg to love her and respect her .
Why did you , if you regret it ? &quot; she said , getting up and running away into the drawing @-@ room .
But now Levin was longing to find out what was tormenting him so , yet he had not the courage to begin .
He was a skeleton covered with skin .
I shan &apos;t murder anybody , and I &apos;ve no need of it .
She was conscious that it was impossible to go away ; but , cheating herself , she went on all the same sorting out her things and pretending she was going .
Stepan Arkadyevitch opened wide his clear , shining eyes .
Not so much from what her mother told her , as from the fact that it was Konstantin &apos;s brother , this pair suddenly seemed to Kitty intensely unpleasant .
He felt that , with no mental effort , could he understand what it was that was _ right _ .
Hey ? &quot; What her father said seemed simple enough , yet at these words Kitty became confused and overcome like a detected criminal .
&quot; But how ?
This feeling was so unexpected and so strange that he did not believe it was the voice of conscience telling him that what he was meaning to do was wrong .
For a moment there would come a lull in the storm , but then it would swoop down again with such onslaughts that it seemed impossible to stand against it .
As he was coming away , the doctor chanced to meet on the staircase an acquaintance of his , Sludin , who was secretary of Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s department .
His whole life had been spent in administrative work , and consequently , when he did not approve of anything , his disapproval was softened by the recognition of the inevitability of mistakes and the possibility of reform in every department .
And hearing that voice , he went into the corner where stood his two heavy dumbbells , and began brandishing them like a gymnast , trying to restore his confident temper .
Such an opinion of him was obviously agreeable to him , and he did not think it necessary to conceal it .
There was something shameful , effeminate , Capuan , as he called it to himself , in his present mode of life .
At his quarters no one was left at home ; all were at the races , and his valet was looking out for him at the gate .
The position was one of misery for all three ; and not one of them would have been equal to enduring this position for a single day , if it had not been for the expectation that it would change , that it was merely a temporary painful ordeal which would pass over .
I can &apos;t be different .... And yet it &apos;s not that , it &apos;s not that . &quot; &quot; What is not that ? &quot; asked Varenka in bewilderment .
I can quote to you thousands of instances ....
Levin she had often met at the Shtcherbatskys &quot; early in the winter , and she had always disliked him .
I was walking along wondering who it could be in a four @-@ in @-@ hand ?
He felt this especially when he talked to the cleverest of the peasants , Ryezunov , and detected the gleam in Ryezunov &apos;s eyes which showed so plainly both ironical amusement at Levin , and the firm conviction that , if anyone were to be taken in , it would not be he , Ryezunov .
&quot; I &apos;ll do it my myself .... &quot; &quot; What say ? &quot; queried Marya Nikolaevna .
&quot; Possibly you do not know me .
But for God &apos;s sake , be quite straightforward with me . &quot; &quot; I tell you what I think , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , smiling .
At every step he experienced what a man would experience who , after admiring the smooth , happy course of a little boat on a lake , should get himself into that little boat .
That &apos;s why most fellows prefer to have to do with Klaras .
&quot; Yes .
Grisha cried , declaring that Nikolinka had whistled too , and he was not punished , and that he wasn &apos;t crying for the tart - he didn &apos;t care - but at being unjustly treated .
Tell me , for God &apos;s sake , &quot; he repeated imploringly .
&quot; Sappho says they did enjoy themselves tremendously at your house last night . &quot; &quot; Ah , how dreary it all was ! &quot; said Liza Merkalova .
&quot; Do what you choose , if it amuses you .
As far as I can make out , they don &apos;t approve of this .
It was three years since Vronsky had seen Serpuhovskoy .
And , what was most important , she wanted to talk about Kitty .
The way in which he had been managing his land revolted him and had lost all attraction for him .
They talk of flirtation .
They sent out to buy a shirt .
Anna , wholly engrossed as she was with the race , became aware of her husband &apos;s cold eyes fixed upon her from one side .
Alexey Alexandrovitch did not want to think at all about his wife &apos;s behavior , and he actually succeeded in not thinking about it at all .
He always attributed to his critics a more profound comprehension than he had himself , and always expected from them something he did not himself see in the picture .
Now the question is : can you go on living with your husband ?
I don &apos;t like bad work myself , nor would I let another man do it .
And he did in fact get across , and startled two ducks .
that &apos;s very nice ! &quot; he said gloomily , looking at the maid .
You &apos;re wretched , he &apos;s wretched , and what good can come of it ?
Do you understand ? &quot; Again her eyes glowed with hatred .
When the last of the hay had been divided , Levin , intrusting the superintendence of the rest to the counting @-@ house clerk , sat down on a haycock marked off by a stake of willow , and looked admiringly at the meadow swarming with peasants .
If she was really in danger , and wished to see him before her death , he would forgive her if he found her alive , and pay her the last duties if he came too late .
She wrote notes to her Moscow acquaintances , put down her accounts , and packed .
I should forget , he would forgive ....
At first , from a feeling of compassion alone , he had been interested in the delicate little creature , who was not his child , and who was cast on one side during her mother &apos;s illness , and would certainly have died if he had not troubled about her , and he did not himself observe how fond he became of her .
She had not complied with his request , and he was bound to punish her and carry out his threat - obtain a divorce and take away his son .
But there was no chance of doing anything ; and twisting the smooth paper @-@ knife in her little hands , she forced herself to read .
&quot; That &apos;s what wicked tongues say , my darling .
Levin looked about him to right and to left , and there , just facing him against the dusky blue sky above the confused mass of tender shoots of the aspens , he saw the flying bird .
What if it &apos;s brother Nikolay ?
&quot; Don &apos;t you think there &apos;s something Louis Quinze about Tushkevitch ? &quot; he said , glancing towards a handsome , fair @-@ haired young man , standing at the table .
He was suddenly radiant : he had understood .
Anna , on whom the position depended , and for whom it was more miserable than for anyone , endured it because she not merely hoped , but firmly believed , that it would all very soon be settled and come right .
She found him as he was sitting with his head in both hands .
While he was changing his clothes , his valet told him that the second race had begun already , that a lot of gentlemen had been to ask for him , and a boy had twice run up from the stables .
Levin saw that , stimulated by his conversation with the doctor , he wanted to talk .
You get up in no haste , you get cross , grumble a little , and come round again .
I could not be the same , no ; but I could forgive it , and forgive it as though it had never been , never been at all .... &quot; &quot; Oh , of course , &quot; Dolly interposed quickly , as though saying what she had more than once thought , &quot; else it would not be forgiveness .
Hope you &apos;re satisfied with the ornament of your study , &quot; he said , indicating the baroness .
The peasants would not give that price , and , as Levin suspected , kept off other purchasers .
Some washed , the young lads bathed in the stream , others made a place comfortable for a rest , untied their sacks of bread , and uncovered the pitchers of rye @-@ beer .
&quot; But why was it you didn &apos;t come to dinner ? &quot; she said , admiring him .
After dinner Levin was sitting , as he usually did , in an easy chair with a book , and as he read he went on thinking of the journey before him in connection with his book .
Alabin was giving a dinner at Darmstadt ; no , not Darmstadt , but something American .
She sat down beside her husband .
Vronsky could not understand how she , with her strong and truthful nature , could endure this state of deceit , and not long to get out of it .
She saw them with her long @-@ sighted eyes , and saw them , too , close by , when they met in the figures , and the more she saw of them the more convinced was she that her unhappiness was complete .
She was not yet asleep .
&quot; How do you look at the question ? &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch slowly emptied his glass of Chablis , never taking his eyes off Levin .
There was one man , a comrade of his at the university , with whom he had made friends later , and with whom he could have spoken of a personal sorrow ; but this friend had a post in the Department of Education in a remote part of Russia .
&quot; I should have thought there was no need to ask . &quot; &quot; You gave that ? &quot; cried Oblonsky , behind , and , pressing his sister &apos;s hand , he added : &quot; Very nice , very nice !
Lily began to bathe , and Darya Alexandrovna began to realize , if only in part , her expectations , if not of a peaceful , at least of a comfortable , life in the country .
They threw down the box , that represented a train , and came in to their father .
Mahotin smiled , showing his long teeth , but Vronsky looked angrily at him .
&quot; I won &apos;t say life wouldn &apos;t be worth living without it , but it would be dull .
She grew thoughtful , and he became serious .
Even now , in the short time she had been in the nursery , the English governess and Matrona Philimonovna had succeeded in putting several questions to her , which did not admit of delay , and which only she could answer : &quot; What were the children to put on for their walk ?
&quot; Yes , yes , marvelous ! &quot; Golenishtchev and Anna assented .
&quot; What &apos;s the matter ?
&quot; However , we won &apos;t discuss it . &quot; &quot; No ; why shouldn &apos;t you come today to dine , anyway ?
He had often heard this word technique , and was utterly unable to understand what was understood by it .
&quot; Scandalous and disgraceful ! &quot; answered the colonel .
It would be too bad .
Indifference , incapacity - I won &apos;t admit ; surely it &apos;s not simply laziness ? &quot; &quot; None of those things .
The English , the French , the Germans , which is at the highest stage of development ?
I keep feeling as if I could cry .
He &apos;s a very intelligent fellow .
Kitty let her eyes rest on Varenka &apos;s face , with a look of dismay and inquiry .
While Levin had been outside , an incident had occurred which had utterly shattered all the happiness she had been feeling that day , and her pride in her children .
He would have gone up to his mare , but he was again detained by an acquaintance .
Nikolay Levin looked round angrily at her .
Well , then , I &apos;ll make you some coffee , so go and wash and get ready , &quot; said the baroness , sitting down again , and anxiously turning the screw in the new coffee pot .
Every time there was heard the creak of the opened door the conversation in the crowd died away , and everybody looked round expecting to see the bride and bridegroom come in .
&quot; Yes , my dear boy , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , nodding his head , &quot; he &apos;s a lucky fellow !
But he was admiring Oblonsky .
&quot; Most likely she knows , &quot; she thought , noticing the sympathy in Anna &apos;s face .
She &apos;s a marvel of sweetness .
On returning home , he carefully scrutinized the hat stand , and noticing that there was not a military overcoat there , he went , as usual , to his own room .
There I might be a help to you and to him .
If truth , do what is proper . &quot; The porter opened the door before Alexey Alexandrovitch rang .
Moreover , she would have been unattractive to men also from the lack of just what Kitty had too much of - of the suppressed fire of vitality , and the consciousness of her own attractiveness .
Then he caught sight of a long , bony , familiar figure , and now it seemed there was no possibility of mistake ; and yet he still went on hoping that this tall man taking off his fur cloak and coughing was not his brother Nikolay .
&quot; Only look ; why , it &apos;s a work of art . &quot; &quot; Yes , everything &apos;s brought to such a pitch of perfection nowadays , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , with a moist and blissful yawn .
&quot; Oh , please , introduce me to Karenin , &quot; he brought out with an effort , and with a desperately determined step he walked into the drawing @-@ room and beheld her .
Anna , in a gray dressing gown , with a crop of short clustering black curls on her round head , was sitting on a settee .
They had to have recourse to the sure , never @-@ failing topic - gossip .
For a long while he could not understand what she had written , and often looked into her eyes .
You &apos;ve been dull , I expect ? &quot; he said .
&quot; Thank God , she &apos;s quite well again .
And it &apos;s a wonder he didn &apos;t know it .
I did not appreciate it , did not make enough of it . &quot; &quot; What &apos;s this ?
The gloomy moment had come that usually precedes the dawn , the full triumph of light over darkness .
&quot; Ah , here you are at last ! &quot; she said , turning with a smile to Vronsky , as he came in .
No , I &apos;m sick of it .
Directly she had gone out , swift , swift light steps sounded on the parquet , and his bliss , his life , himself - what was best in himself , what he had so long sought and longed for - was quickly , so quickly approaching him .
&quot; Oh , no , I &apos;m not an enemy of matrimony .
&quot; Father began saying something to me just now ....
&quot; Is it long since you went to see them ? &quot; &quot; We &apos;re meaning to make an expedition to the mountains tomorrow , &quot; answered Kitty .
Shtcherbatsky moved away from them , and Kitty , going up to a card @-@ table , sat down , and , taking up the chalk , began drawing diverging circles over the new green cloth .
She loves Anna like a sister , she loves you , and she &apos;s a wonderful woman .
The bright sun , the brilliant green of the foliage , the strains of the music were for her the natural setting of all these familiar faces , with their changes to greater emaciation or to convalescence , for which she watched .
&quot; It was a bad shot from the right barrel , &quot; responded Stepan Arkadyevitch , loading his gun .
She walked across the drawing @-@ room and went resolutely to him .
What is wrong with her ?
Alexey Alexandrovitch bowed frigidly , and kissing his wife &apos;s hand , asked how she was .
&quot; What is it they write to you ? &quot; he repeated .
&quot; We &apos;ve no power over them .
&quot; I &apos;ll go alone with my child . &quot; &quot; Yes , it &apos;s very wrong , &quot; said Anna , and taking her son by the shoulder she looked at him , not severely , but with a timid glance that bewildered and delighted the boy , and she kissed him .
But directly she had said this he suddenly drew himself up , and a proud and hard expression came over his face .
Countess Nordston found Korsunsky , with whom she was to dance the mazurka , and told him to ask Kitty .
&quot; I am his sister , I know his character , that faculty of forgetting everything , everything &quot; ( she waved her hand before her forehead ) , &quot; that faculty for being completely carried away , but for completely repenting too .
He jeered at the way in which she arranged the furniture they had brought from Moscow ; rearranged their room ; hung up curtains ; prepared rooms for visitors ; a room for Dolly ; saw after an abode for her new maid ; ordered dinner of the old cook ; came into collision with Agafea Mihalovna , taking from her the charge of the stores .
&quot; What did you say ? &quot; Levin cried with horror .
Every girl &apos;s proud of an offer . &quot; &quot; Yes , every girl , but not she . &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled .
The priest , a little old man with a scanty grizzled beard and weary , good @-@ natured eyes , was standing at the altar @-@ rails , turning over the pages of a missal .
She got up and embraced her sister @-@ in @-@ law .
After the departure of the doctor , he wanted to go with a fishing rod to the river .
&quot; She &apos;s found it !
&quot; Take the reforms of Peter , of Catherine , of Alexander .
The department hostile to Alexey Alexandrovitch proved that the condition of the native tribes was exceedingly flourishing , that the proposed reconstruction might be the ruin of their prosperity , and that if there were anything wrong , it arose mainly from the failure on the part of Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s department to carry out the measures prescribed by law .
Just like one of the peasants , all day long ? &quot; &quot; Yes , it &apos;s very pleasant , &quot; said Levin .
I &apos;m not going to drink today . &quot; &quot; Why , are you gaining weight ?
&quot; Ah , the young man !
More than twenty carriages had already been drawn up in ranks along the street by the police .
&quot; What a fine fellow ! &quot; &quot; The lad &apos;s all right . &quot; &quot; Married already ? &quot; &quot; Yes , it &apos;s two years last St. Philip &apos;s day . &quot; &quot; Any children ? &quot; &quot; Children indeed !
When he saw that smile , submissive and humble , Levin felt something clutching at his throat .
&quot; That &apos;s the only way , the only way left us . &quot; He had recovered himself , and lifted his head .
His eyes shone particularly brightly , and he felt in that confident , calm , and happy frame of mind which always came after he had thoroughly faced his position .
She knew that in one way or another she would tell Anna everything , and she was alternately glad at the thought of speaking freely , and angry at the necessity of speaking of her humiliation with her , his sister , and of hearing her ready @-@ made phrases of good advice and comfort .
She &apos;s so sweet ; but you and I can &apos;t deceive ourselves .
Ah , my God , what agony !
&quot; You don &apos;t care much for oysters , do you ? &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , emptying his wine @-@ glass , &quot; or you &apos;re worried about something .
Betsy waved her handkerchief to him .
But remembering what was in store for her alone at home , if she did not come to some decision , remembering that gesture - terrible even in memory - when she had clutched her hair in both hands - she said good @-@ bye and went away .
Levin , not without an inner struggle , handed her his diary .
I &apos;m not dining at home . &quot; He got up and moved towards the door .
I had meant to come to the mowing to look at you , but it was so unbearably hot that I got no further than the forest .
&quot; What is so exquisite , &quot; he thought , as he returned from the Shtcherbatskys , &quot; carrying away with him , as he always did , a delicious feeling of purity and freshness , arising partly from the fact that he had not been smoking for a whole evening , and with it a new feeling of tenderness at her love for him - &quot; what is so exquisite is that not a word has been said by me or by her , but we understand each other so well in this unseen language of looks and tones , that this evening more clearly than ever she told me she loves me .
&quot; You startled me , &quot; she said .
From the moment that Anna loved Vronsky , he had regarded his own right over her as the one thing unassailable .
She passed the paper @-@ knife over the window pane , then laid its smooth , cool surface to her cheek , and almost laughed aloud at the feeling of delight that all at once without cause came over her .
Kitty felt overwhelmed , and her face showed it .
He noticed this , rubbed his forehead , and sat down in her boudoir .
Anyway , the thing &apos;s done , and there &apos;s an end of it .
Stiva !
Shall I give you some ? &quot; said the master of the house .
&quot; I &apos;ve simply come to see you . &quot; His brother &apos;s timidity obviously softened Nikolay .
Konstantin Dmitrievitch ! &quot; ( These latter days she used these names almost alternately . )
&quot; I &apos;m for Vronsky .
Her heart throbbed violently , and her thoughts would not rest on anything .
You are such purity that .... &quot; He took her hand and did not kiss it ( to kiss her hand in such closeness to death seemed to him improper ) ; he merely squeezed it with a penitent air , looking at her brightening eyes .
She was talking rapidly , musically , and with exceptionally correct articulation and expressive intonation .
But today that satisfaction was embittered by Matrona Philimonovna &apos;s advice and the unsatisfactory state of the household .
Stepan Arkadyevitch shot two more birds and Levin two , of which one was not found .
And you tell them to take a lantern .
The snow of the little quadrangle before the house was lit up by a light in the bedroom windows of his old nurse , Agafea Mihalovna , who performed the duties of housekeeper in his house .
&quot; To the England or the Hermitage ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mind which . &quot; &quot; All right , then , the England , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , selecting that restaurant because he owed more there than at the Hermitage , and consequently considered it mean to avoid it .
But at the moment he was getting up , he caught the sound of the dying man stirring .
But he felt that he could not do that either .
But the sufferings of a man who was your husband have no interest for you .
This is from my people and from Dolly .
It appeared that he had forgotten nothing except what he wanted to forget - his wife .
This child , with his innocent outlook upon life , was the compass that showed them the point to which they had departed from what they knew , but did not want to know .
These measures , still further exaggerated in opposition to what was Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s fundamental idea , were passed by the commission , and then the aim of Stremov &apos;s tactics became apparent .
Now , in the heyday of his highest glory , his fullest flower , he would have to be a liar or a scoffer .
I know you are a truly magnanimous man , &quot; said Betsy , stopping in the little drawing @-@ room , and with special warmth shaking hands with him once more .
Obviously he did not care in the least what his reasoning led him to ; all he wanted was the process of reasoning .
He felt that in the depth of his soul something had been put in its place , settled down , and laid to rest .
While still outside his own door , as he rang , he heard masculine laughter , the lisp of a feminine voice , and Petritsky &apos;s voice .
He made haste to move away from her , as from a dirty place .
It was that time of the year , the turning @-@ point of summer , when the crops of the present year are a certainty , when one begins to think of the sowing for next year , and the mowing is at hand ; when the rye is all in ear , though its ears are still light , not yet full , and it waves in gray @-@ green billows in the wind ; when the green oats , with tufts of yellow grass scattered here and there among it , droop irregularly over the late @-@ sown fields ; when the early buckwheat is already out and hiding the ground ; when the fallow lands , trodden hard as stone by the cattle , are half ploughed over , with paths left untouched by the plough ; when from the dry dung @-@ heaps carted onto the fields there comes at sunset a smell of manure mixed with meadow @-@ sweet , and on the low @-@ lying lands the riverside meadows are a thick sea of grass waiting for the mowing , with blackened heaps of the stalks of sorrel among it .
He came out on to the highroad and walked , picking his way carefully through the mud , to his carriage .
She was very much tired ....
After dinner he spent half an hour with his guests , and again , with a smile , pressed his wife &apos;s hand , withdrew , and drove off to the council .
Yes , &quot; said Anna .
&quot; Marvelous ! &quot; said someone .
&quot; Yes , &quot; he thought , &quot; this now is life , this is happiness !
When she went into his study he was in official uniform , obviously ready to go out , sitting at a little table on which he rested his elbows , looking dejectedly before him .
And why , why is he interested in the partition of Poland ? &quot; When Sviazhsky had finished , Levin could not help asking : &quot; Well , and what then ? &quot; But there was nothing to follow .
Feeling angry with his wife because what he had expected had come to pass , which was that at the moment of arrival , when his heart throbbed with emotion and anxiety to know how his brother was getting on , he should have to be seeing after her , instead of rushing straight to his brother , Levin conducted her to the room assigned them .
The stand @-@ shooting was capital .
&quot; Then what do you think ? &quot; he asked ; &quot; what system is one to adopt nowadays ? &quot; &quot; Why , manage like Mihail Petrovitch , or let the land for half the crop or for rent to the peasants ; that one can do - only that &apos;s just how the general prosperity of the country is being ruined .
All right then , we &apos;ll have a drink together !
In former years the hay had been bought by the peasants for twenty roubles the three acres .
The better he knew his brother , the more he noticed that Sergey Ivanovitch , and many other people who worked for the public welfare , were not led by an impulse of the heart to care for the public good , but reasoned from intellectual considerations that it was a right thing to take interest in public affairs , and consequently took interest in them .
what could I do ? &quot; he kept saying in a pitiful voice , not knowing what he was saying , as his head sank lower and lower .
&quot; Oh , don &apos;t you come , &quot; said the sick man angrily .
But in spite of his affection and respect for Sergey Ivanovitch , Konstantin Levin was uncomfortable with his brother in the country .
How often during those eight years of happy life with his wife Alexey Alexandrovitch had looked at other men &apos;s faithless wives and other deceived husbands and asked himself : &quot; How can people descend to that ?
Bertenev &apos;s party against the Russian communists ? &quot; &quot; No , &quot; said Serpuhovskoy , frowning with vexation at being suspected of such an absurdity .
Konstantin Levin was very glad to have him , especially as he did not expect his brother Nikolay that summer .
Doctor , give me some morphine !
I &apos;ve been learning about them at those - what &apos;s their names ? ...
&quot; It &apos;s an omen of evil , &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t see that .
I would ask you to let me know what are your terms . &quot; &quot; It may be obtained if you give me complete liberty of action , &quot; said the lawyer , not answering his question .
I can &apos;t live with him .
uncover your face , do uncover it ! &quot; she said angrily .
Coming back from the doctor to whom Kitty had sent him , Levin , on opening the door , came upon the sick man at the instant when , by Kitty &apos;s directions , they were changing his linen .
Anna Arkadyevna read and understood , but it was distasteful to her to read , that is , to follow the reflection of other people &apos;s lives .
He was thinking of Anna &apos;s promise to see him that day after the races .
&quot; What you spoke of just now was a mistake , and not love . &quot; &quot; Remember that I have forbidden you to utter that word , that hateful word , &quot; said Anna , with a shudder .
Levin listened to them , and saw clearly that these missing sums and these pipes were not anything real , and that they were not at all angry , but were all the nicest , kindest people , and everything was as happy and charming as possible among them .
Above all , he felt the instability and unnaturalness of his relations with his wife .
It &apos;s exquisite !
For a minute he was still , and with the same despondent face gazed at the baby ; but all at once a smile , that moved his hair and the skin of his forehead , came out on his face , and he went as softly out of the room .
what have I done ! &quot; A crowd of men , a doctor and his assistant , the officers of his regiment , ran up to him .
Chapter 24 &quot; Yes , there is something in me hateful , repulsive , &quot; thought Levin , as he came away from the Shtcherbatskys , &quot; and walked in the direction of his brother &apos;s lodgings .
He felt what a murderer must feel , when he sees the body he has robbed of life .
A bald , well @-@ preserved old man , with a broad , red beard , gray on his cheeks , opened the gate , squeezing against the gatepost to let the three horses pass .
&quot; But tomorrow it &apos;ll be your turn to be tried ; would it have suited your tastes better to be tried in the old criminal tribunal ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to be tried .
Stepan Arkadyevitch saw Matvey wanted to make a joke and attract attention to himself .
Meanwhile men ran to and fro , talking merrily together , their steps crackling on the platform as they continually opened and closed the big doors .
The question of the Native Tribes had been brought up incidentally in the Commission of the 2nd of June , and had been pressed forward actively by Alexey Alexandrovitch as one admitting of no delay on account of the deplorable condition of the native tribes .
He had both prepared for the university with the young Prince Shtcherbatsky , the brother of Kitty and Dolly , and had entered at the same time with him .
While awaiting the time for carrying out her plans on a large scale , however , Kitty , even then at the springs , where there were so many people ill and unhappy , readily found a chance for practicing her new principles in imitation of Varenka .
Those joys were so small that they passed unnoticed , like gold in sand , and at bad moments she could see nothing but the pain , nothing but sand ; but there were good moments too when she saw nothing but the joy , nothing but gold .
But she enjoyed the struggle .
&quot; You like turbot , don &apos;t you ? &quot; he said to Levin as they were arriving .
How I should like to know it and to learn it of her ! &quot; thought Kitty , gazing into her serene face .
&quot; There must be snipe too , &quot; he thought , and just as he reached the turning homewards he met the forest keeper , who confirmed his theory about the snipe .
In spite of the village elder &apos;s assertions about the compressibility of hay , and its having settled down in the stacks , and his swearing that everything had been done in the fear of God , Levin stuck to his point that the hay had been divided without his orders , and that , therefore , he would not accept that hay as fifty loads to a stack .
Kouzma has got everything ready for you . &quot; &quot; No , I don &apos;t feel hungry even .
One must take the consequences .... &quot; &quot; But she won &apos;t see me . &quot; &quot; You do your part .
&quot; Yes ; and I heard news of you , but not only through your wife , &quot; said Vronsky , checking his hint by a stern expression of face .
The questions one must ask oneself !
The lady smiled a kindly smile too , and she too waved her hand to Alexey Alexandrovitch .
Since his return from abroad Alexey Alexandrovitch had twice been at their country villa .
The storm swooped down , enveloped him and the haycock on which he was lying , and the other haycocks , and the wagon @-@ loads , and the whole meadow and distant fields all seemed to be shaking and singing to the measures of this wild merry song with its shouts and whistles and clapping .
Do you understand the folly of it , that on the pretext of my being unfaithful to him , &quot; she said contemptuously , &quot; he wants to get the benefit of my fortune . &quot; Vronsky heard with pleasure this light @-@ hearted prattle of a pretty woman , agreed with her , gave her half @-@ joking counsel , and altogether dropped at once into the tone habitual to him in talking to such women .
Anna craned forward , listening .
How badly these flowers are done - not a bit like a violet , &quot; she said , pointing to the hangings .
Forgive me ! &quot; she said , sobbing , pressing his hands to her bosom .
But he was not destined to escape .
&quot; Very good , electricity and heat are the same thing ; but is it possible to substitute the one quantity for the other in the equation for the solution of any problem ?
&quot; I can &apos;t !
&quot; Come , now ....
But even as he was , he was charming , with his fair curls , his blue eyes , and his plump , graceful little legs in tightly pulled @-@ up stockings .
I lose ten thalers . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s simply from boredom , &quot; said the princess .
That was just why I have not been to see you .
Possibly against my own will .... &quot; She crimsoned and stopped .
This was evident from his confusion and embarrassment in reading the minutes .
The mother was much more cheerful when she went back to her daughter , and Kitty pretended to be more cheerful .
What can be done if married people find that life is impossible for them together ?
He at once perceived it , and blushed too .
&quot; Is there anything troubling you ? - though I &apos;ve no right to ask such a question , &quot; he added hurriedly .
These principles laid down as invariable rules : that one must pay a cardsharper , but need not pay a tailor ; that one must never tell a lie to a man , but one may to a woman ; that one must never cheat anyone , but one may a husband ; that one must never pardon an insult , but one may give one and so on .
Nikolay said that he had come now to take this money and , what was more important , to stay a while in the old nest , to get in touch with the earth , so as to renew his strength like the heroes of old for the work that lay before him .
&quot; Is she feeling the same as I ? &quot; And looking round , he met her eyes , and from their expression he concluded that she was understanding it just as he was .
But he felt that he was full of the most splendid plans and projects .
He just had time to free his leg when she fell on one side , gasping painfully , and , making vain efforts to rise with her delicate , soaking neck , she fluttered on the ground at his feet like a shot bird .
We must raise our farming to a higher level . &quot; &quot; Oh , if one only had the means to do it , Nikolay Ivanovitch !
&quot; Anna is coming today . &quot; &quot; Well , what is that to me ?
&quot; Of my fault and my remorse I cannot speak , because .... &quot; She stopped again , finding no connection in her ideas .
I thought we weren &apos;t going , &quot; his wife answered crossly .
He was in the most light @-@ hearted mood .
I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s this , don &apos;t you see , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , &quot; you &apos;re very much all of a piece .
She is expected to make her choice , and yet she cannot choose , she can only answer &quot; yes &quot; or &quot; no . &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes , to choose between me and Vronsky , &quot; thought Levin , and the dead thing that had come to life within him died again , and only weighed on his heart and set it aching .
What are you thinking of ? &quot; he said reproachfully .
I am in such doubt of everything that I even hate my son , and sometimes do not believe he is my son .
&quot; He has gone !
For him to say he knew the peasantry would have been the same as to say he knew men .
Stepan Arkadyevitch did not come out .
And so it &apos;s come about that I &apos;m a cause of quarrel , and that I &apos;ve done what nobody asked me to do .
&quot; I have nothing else to say .
He has a heart of gold . &quot; &quot; How could you find out what sort of heart he has ? &quot; &quot; We are great friends .
&quot; Yes , Stiva told me you danced the mazurka with him , and that he .... &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t imagine how absurdly it all came about .
Kitty looked into his face , which was so close to her own , and long afterwards - for several years after - that look , full of love , to which he made no response , cut her to the heart with an agony of shame .
What &apos;s the matter with you ?
He wanted to speak to you . &quot; &quot; Well , let us go , then , &quot; said Kitty , turning round resolutely .
She wrote , &quot; I am ill and unhappy .
She had only just time to go into her dressing @-@ room , sprinkle her long , pale face with powder , rub it , set her dress to rights , and order tea in the big drawing @-@ room , when one after another carriages drove up to her huge house in Bolshaia Morskaia .
&quot; The courier has orders to wait for an answer , &quot; he said .
While the priest was reading it , the dying man did not show any sign of life ; his eyes were closed .
&quot; But what did you do while it was raining ? &quot; &quot; Rain ?
If Alexey Alexandrovitch had allowed himself to observe he would have noticed the timid and bewildered eyes with which Seryozha glanced first at his father and then at his mother .
After dinner , Anna went up to her room to dress , and Dolly followed her .
That &apos;s right ; lunch , then . &quot; Levin gave his scythe to Tit , and together with the peasants , who were crossing the long stretch of mown grass , slightly sprinkled with rain , to get their bread from the heap of coats , he went towards his house .
He took his palette and began to work .
He liked it awfully .
&quot; So at the Français ! &quot; and , with a rustle of her skirts , she vanished .
Then , too , his brother &apos;s talk of communism , which he had treated so lightly at the time , now made him think .
She could not solve the problem her father had unconsciously set her by his good @-@ humored view of her friends , and of the life that had so attracted her .
The lawyer , with a swiftness that could never have been expected of him , opened his hands , caught the moth , and resumed his former attitude .
Kitty did not even notice her .
&quot; He has been at home , &quot; she thought , &quot; and didn &apos;t find me , and thought I should be here , but he did not come up because he thought it late , and Anna &apos;s here . &quot; All of them looked at each other , saying nothing , and began to look at Anna &apos;s album .
Meanwhile , Alexey Alexandrovitch was holding his son by the shoulder while he was speaking to the governess , and Seryozha was so miserably uncomfortable that Anna saw he was on the point of tears .
&quot; The princess is in the garden ; they will inform her immediately .
All right , good @-@ bye !
The princess laughed at her husband for his Russian ways , but she was more lively and good @-@ humored than she had been all the while she had been at the waters .
He would have talked with him , and tried to comfort him , but remembering that he had nothing but his shirt on , he changed his mind and sat down again at the open pane to bathe in the cold air and gaze at the exquisite lines of the cross , silent , but full of meaning for him , and the mounting lurid yellow star .
When the princess came to them , they were sitting side by side on the chest , sorting the dresses and disputing over Kitty &apos;s wanting to give Dunyasha the brown dress she had been wearing when Levin proposed to her , while he insisted that that dress must never be given away , but Dunyasha must have the blue one .
Our Kitty has learned to skate nicely , hasn &apos;t she ? &quot; When Levin darted up to Kitty her face was no longer stern ; her eyes looked at him with the same sincerity and friendliness , but Levin fancied that in her friendliness there was a certain note of deliberate composure .
At first they laughed behind their hands and did not understand her questions , but soon they grew bolder and began to talk , winning Darya Alexandrovna &apos;s heart at once by the genuine admiration of the children that they showed .
Levin followed him , trying not to get left behind , and he found it harder and harder : the moment came when he felt he had no strength left , but at that very moment Tit stopped and whetted the scythes .
He was on the point of getting up , when the princess , noticing that he was silent , addressed him .
&quot; It will end sooner than you and your lover have planned !
We lounged about on sofas all the evening .
And , well , you know one can &apos;t say that of oneself . &quot; &quot; &quot; No one is satisfied with his fortune , and everyone is satisfied with his wit . &quot; &quot; The attaché repeated the French saying .
Suddenly Nikolay stirred , and began to say something .
&quot; Well , how is your district council doing ? &quot; asked Sergey Ivanovitch , who was greatly interested in these local boards and attached great importance to them .
He even raised himself when his soup was brought , and asked for a cutlet as well .
His whole soul was filled with memories of Kitty , and there was a smile of triumph and happiness shining in his eyes .
Her coiffure was not striking .
&quot; Why is it Marie &apos;s in lilac , as bad as black , at a wedding ? &quot; said Madame Korsunskaya .
Kitty played the opening bars , and looked round at Varenka .
The day after his arrival the prince , in his long overcoat , with his Russian wrinkles and baggy cheeks propped up by a starched collar , set off with his daughter to the spring in the greatest good humor .
I can &apos;t understand what you want to torment me for .
&quot; Ah ! &quot; cried the prince , catching sight of the Moscow colonel standing near , and with a bow to Madame Stahl he walked away with his daughter and the Moscow colonel , who joined them .
Before you &apos;ve time to look round , you feel that you can &apos;t love your wife with love , however much you may esteem her .
Let &apos;s go to the Gypsies !
At that moment she knew beyond doubt that he had come early on purpose to find her alone and to make her an offer .
He examined the wrist , said it was not broken , was delighted at a chance of talking to the celebrated Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev , and to show his advanced views of things told him all the scandal of the district , complaining of the poor state into which the district council had fallen .
That &apos;s just the question ! &quot; said Petritsky solemnly , moving his forefinger upwards from his nose .
He rubbed his face with his handkerchief , and wrapping round him his coat , which sat extremely well as it was , he greeted them with a smile , holding out his hand to Stepan Arkadyevitch , as though he wanted to catch something .
Anna , who had flushed a little the instant her son came in , noticing that Seryozha was uncomfortable , got up hurriedly , took Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s hand from her son &apos;s shoulder , and kissing the boy , led him out onto the terrace , and quickly came back .
Suppose I call him out , &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch went on to himself , and vividly picturing the night he would spend after the challenge , and the pistol aimed at him , he shuddered , and knew that he never would do it - &quot; suppose I call him out .
&quot; I don &apos;t know you with this short hair .
How many times had Levin seen this splendid fodder wasted , and tried to get it saved ; but always it had turned out to be impossible .
He sat down , tucked the tiger @-@ skin rug round him , and lighted a cigar .
&quot; Is it really time ?
Vronsky had wanted to pay the money at the time ( he had that amount then ) , but Venovsky and Yashvin had insisted that they would pay and not Vronsky , who had not played .
And we &apos;ve started gymnastic exercises . &quot; &quot; No , thank you , I won &apos;t have any more tea , &quot; said Levin , and conscious of doing a rude thing , but incapable of continuing the conversation , he got up , blushing .
&quot; And how is she ? &quot; Korney in his morning apron ran downstairs .
Tanya was pulling Grisha &apos;s hair , while he , with a face hideous with rage , was beating her with his fists wherever he could get at her .
Golenishtchev was the first to give expression to an idea that had occurred to all of them , which was that Mihailov was simply jealous of Vronsky .
Never speak to me of it .
Chapter 14 As he rode up to the house in the happiest frame of mind , Levin heard the bell ring at the side of the principal entrance of the house .
The position of Alexey Alexandrovitch , owing to this , and partly owing to the contempt lavished on him for his wife &apos;s infidelity , became very precarious .
If she read that the heroine of the novel was nursing a sick man , she longed to move with noiseless steps about the room of a sick man ; if she read of a member of Parliament making a speech , she longed to be delivering the speech ; if she read of how Lady Mary had ridden after the hounds , and had provoked her sister @-@ in @-@ law , and had surprised everyone by her boldness , she too wished to be doing the same .
&quot; He &apos;s broken his leg too , so they say , &quot; the general was saying .
&quot; Well , God be with you , &quot; she said at the door of the study , where a shaded candle and a decanter of water were already put by his armchair .
She spoke very simply and naturally , but too much and too fast .
It was as though there were something in this which she could not or would not face , as though directly she began to speak of this , she , the real Anna , retreated somehow into herself , and another strange and unaccountable woman came out , whom he did not love , and whom he feared , and who was in opposition to him .
But , bethinking himself that this would not help matters , he stopped short in the middle of a sentence , and merely sighed .
&quot; I know , &quot; he thought , &quot; that fashion not only in him , but in all city people , who , after being twice in ten years in the country , pick up two or three phrases and use them in season and out of season , firmly persuaded that they know all about it .
Moving off from the steps , the old man went up to the horses and began unharnessing them .
When she had finished , she felt that she was cold all over , and that a fearful calamity , such as she had not expected , had burst upon her .
He spent the remainder of the time in the street , incessantly looking at his watch and gazing about him .
&quot; Come , why do you stay on at home ?
He knew that when the time came , and when he saw his enemy facing him , and studiously endeavoring to assume an expression of indifference , his speech would flow of itself better than he could prepare it now .
Levin &apos;s warmth gave him genuine pleasure .
get us some supper and some wine if there &apos;s any left ; or else go and get some . &quot; The woman rose , came out from behind the screen , and saw Konstantin .
Round her well @-@ cut , strong neck was a thread of pearls .
The nervous agitation of Alexey Alexandrovitch kept increasing , and had by now reached such a point that he ceased to struggle with it .
The culprit was sitting at the window in the corner of the drawing @-@ room ; beside him was standing Tanya with a plate .
Over six thousand acres in the Karazinsky district ; everything before him ; and what youth and vigor !
&quot; Oh , it &apos;s awful !
Anna knew that Betsy knew everything , but , hearing how she spoke of Vronsky before her , she almost felt persuaded for a minute that she knew nothing .
This Levin , with his continual twitching of his head , aroused in her now an irrepressible feeling of disgust .
She loved Anna , but she enjoyed seeing that she too had her weaknesses .
&quot; Let me ask you , Konstantin Dmitrievitch , &quot; said Darya Alexandrovna , smiling her kindly and rather mocking smile , &quot; why is it you are angry with Kitty ? &quot; &quot; I ?
The German princess said , &quot; I hope the roses will soon come back to this pretty little face , &quot; and for the Shtcherbatskys certain definite lines of existence were at once laid down from which there was no departing .
Now I have come .... &quot; &quot; Oh , what a lucky fellow you are ! &quot; broke in Stepan Arkadyevitch , looking into Levin &apos;s eyes .
&quot; You set off with the mother and you return with the son , &quot; he said , articulating each syllable , as though each were a separate favor he was bestowing .
Someone coming , &quot; he thought , catching the tinkle of bells , and lifting his head .
There were several races fixed for that day : the Mounted Guards &quot; race , then the officers &quot; mile @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half race , then the three @-@ mile race , and then the race for which he was entered .
&quot; How absurd !
One thing &apos;s certain , this night has decided my fate .
&quot; But you said yourself the people are at such a low stage of material development : what help are schools for that ? &quot; &quot; Do you know , you remind me of the story of the advice given to the sick man - You should try purgative medicine .
In spite of his exaggerated stoop , and the emaciation that was so striking from his height , his movements were as rapid and abrupt as ever .
On arriving at twelve o &apos;clock from the station at his flat , Vronsky saw , at the outer door , a hired carriage familiar to him .
I know you .
Kitty danced in the first couple , and luckily for her she had not to talk , because Korsunsky was all the time running about directing the figure .
And to wound him cruelly .
&quot; Why , I believe it &apos;s nine years since I &apos;ve taken the sacrament !
&quot; No , thanks , I can &apos;t drink any more , &quot; said Levin , pushing away his glass .
&quot; I think I &apos;ve had the pleasure of meeting you , &quot; he said , looking uneasily first at Anna , then at Vronsky , in fear of losing any shade of their expression .
You come with me to Paris instead of to Mulhausen .
&quot; You &apos;re not racing ? &quot; the officer asked , chaffing him .
&quot; I &apos;m glad you &apos;ve been seeing her pretty often . &quot; &quot; She &apos;s friendly with Varya , and they &apos;re the only women in Petersburg I care about seeing , &quot; answered Vronsky , smiling .
My mother @-@ in @-@ law and all of them are still abroad . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s capital !
&quot; I believe I was to have dined with you this winter , &quot; he said , smiling his simple and open smile ; &quot; but you had unexpectedly left for the country . &quot; &quot; Konstantin Dmitrievitch despises and hates town and us townspeople , &quot; said Countess Nordston .
A pretty maid in an apron might be even more agreeable , perhaps ; but for your severe monastic style it does very well . &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch told him many interesting pieces of news ; especially interesting to Levin was the news that his brother , Sergey Ivanovitch , was intending to pay him a visit in the summer .
Kitty stood by her father &apos;s chair , still holding his hand .
But the only system that does answer is where laborer is working in accordance with his habits , just as on the old peasant &apos;s land half @-@ way here .
She looked nice .
In spite of the old man &apos;s complaints , it was evident that he was proud , and justly proud , of his prosperity , proud of his sons , his nephew , his sons &quot; wives , his horses and his cows , and especially of the fact that he was keeping all this farming going .
Stepan Arkadyevitch had not chosen his political opinions or his views ; these political opinions and views had come to him of themselves , just as he did not choose the shapes of his hat and coat , but simply took those that were being worn .
&quot; Not bad , &quot; he said , stripping the oysters from the pearly shell with a silver fork , and swallowing them one after another .
&quot; Brandy , do you think ?
&quot; I sent to find out where he is living , and sent him his IOU to Trubin , which I paid .
&quot; Sergey Ivanovitch ?
It &apos;s all the Ivanov @-@ Strauss @-@ Renan attitude to Christ and to religious painting . &quot; &quot; What is the subject of the picture ? &quot; asked Anna .
Here , in the country , with children , and with Darya Alexandrovna , with whom he was in sympathy , Levin was in a mood not infrequent with him , of childlike light @-@ heartedness that she particularly liked in him .
The Schulze @-@ Delitsch movement .... And then all this enormous literature of the labor question , the most liberal Lassalle movement ... the Mulhausen experiment ?
&quot; But we won &apos;t talk of him . &quot; Chapter 23 Vronsky had several times already , though not so resolutely as now , tried to bring her to consider their position , and every time he had been confronted by the same superficiality and triviality with which she met his appeal now .
She was silent for a little , thinking of herself , of her own grief in her family , and all at once , with an impulsive movement , she raised her head and clasped her hands with an imploring gesture .
&quot; Who was that came in ? &quot; he asked the doorkeeper .
But he went on : &quot; I imagine that it &apos;s not illness , but your condition .
But I came to myself again ; and who did it ?
&quot; If you love your child as a good father , you will not desire only wealth , luxury , honor for your infant ; you will be anxious for his salvation , his spiritual enlightenment with the light of truth .
The memories of childhood and of Levin &apos;s friendship with her dead brother gave a special poetic charm to her relations with him .
In the choir the bored choristers could be heard trying their voices and blowing their noses .
Chapter 23 Vronsky &apos;s wound had been a dangerous one , though it did not touch the heart , and for several days he had lain between life and death .
&quot; My God !
Is this number seven ? &quot; Levin was standing with a peasant from Tver in the middle of the room , measuring a fresh bearskin , when Stepan Arkadyevitch went in .
Anna lifted the wasted , thin hand of Dolly , kissed it and said : &quot; But , Dolly , what &apos;s to be done , what &apos;s to be done ?
&quot; Put it on quite , &quot; voices were heard urging when the priest had put on the wedding crowns and Shtcherbatsky , his hand shaking in its three @-@ button glove , held the crown high above her head .
Kindly leave the room ! &quot; he would commonly cry in such cases .
I &apos;ve just been to make peace between them . &quot; &quot; Well , and what then ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the most interesting part of the story .
&quot; Goodness !
Chapter 15 Though Anna had obstinately and with exasperation contradicted Vronsky when he told her their position was impossible , at the bottom of her heart she regarded her own position as false and dishonorable , and she longed with her whole soul to change it .
Now , since the youngest had come out , she was going through the same terrors , the same doubts , and still more violent quarrels with her husband than she had over the elder girls .
How often she had mused on the subject , thinking of her friend abroad , Varenka , of her painful state of dependence , how often she had wondered about herself what would become of her if she did not marry , and how often she had argued with her sister about it !
&quot; You are entering upon a time of life , &quot; pursued the priest , &quot; when you must choose your path and keep to it .
They unyoked the horses and galloped after them . &quot; &quot; Well , what do you say , Fomitch - start mowing or wait a bit ? &quot; &quot; Eh , well .
Very wealthy , clever , of aristocratic family , on the highroad to a brilliant career in the army and at court , and a fascinating man .
I gave her a chance to reform , I tried to save her .
How nice it all was !
&quot; But why is it his ears stick out so strangely ?
Levin went to the steps , took a run from above as best he could , and dashed down , preserving his balance in this unwonted movement with his hands .
The bailiff , beaming all over , like everyone that day , in a sheepskin bordered with astrachan , came out of the barn , twisting a bit of straw in his hands .
And that state of things must be changed , &quot; he finished up , and he looked questioningly at his brother .
In spite of the gloominess of nature around him , he felt peculiarly eager .
Chapter 3 A crowd of people , principally women , was thronging round the church lighted up for the wedding .
No one knew better than Stepan Arkadyevitch how to hit on the exact line between freedom , simplicity , and official stiffness necessary for the agreeable conduct of business .
He was painfully conscious himself , as were all about him , that at his years it is not well for man to be alone .
Vronsky saw him without looking round get into the carriage , pick up the rug and the opera @-@ glass at the window and disappear .
Even though one catches nothing , it &apos;s nice .
&quot; Yes , it &apos;s settled .
Invite all the young bucks .
This silence was so awkward for both of them that Stepan Arkadyevitch &apos;s lips began twitching nervously , while he still gazed without speaking at Karenin &apos;s face .
Better have one of Annie &quot; ( so she called her baby girl ) .
But in that nervous tension , and in the visions that filled her imagination , there was nothing disagreeable or gloomy : on the contrary there was something blissful , glowing , and exhilarating .
Left alone in the room assigned him , lying on a spring mattress that yielded unexpectedly at every movement of his arm or his leg , Levin did not fall asleep for a long while .
&quot; And how dared I associate a thought of anything not innocent with this touching creature ?
With a face hideous with passion , his lower jaw trembling , and his cheeks white , Vronsky kicked her with his heel in the stomach and again fell to tugging at the rein .
Noticing , however , that Mihailov was expecting a criticism of the picture , he said : &quot; Your picture has got on a great deal since I saw it last time ; and what strikes me particularly now , as it did then , is the figure of Pilate .
There &apos;s something common , vulgar , in flirting with one &apos;s governess .
But she had heard of late that her son had refused a position offered him of great importance to his career , simply in order to remain in the regiment , where he could be constantly seeing Madame Karenina .
&quot; I did not mean , &quot; he said over the soup , addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch , &quot; mere density of population alone , but in conjunction with fundamental ideas , and not by means of principles . &quot; &quot; It seems to me , &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch said languidly , and with no haste , &quot; that that &apos;s the same thing .
I will tell you some time , &quot; said Levin , but he began telling him at once .
&quot; Dolly ! &quot; he repeated , with a quiver in his voice .
&quot; Admitting that a certain quite irrational _ ridicule _ falls to the lot of these men , yet I never saw anything but a misfortune in it , and always felt sympathy for it , &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself , though indeed this was not the fact , and he had never felt sympathy for misfortunes of that kind , but the more frequently he had heard of instances of unfaithful wives betraying their husbands , the more highly he had thought of himself .
Deliberately she shrouded the light in her eyes , but it shone against her will in the faintly perceptible smile .
How awful ! &quot; &quot; Couldn &apos;t one do anything for her ? &quot; said Madame Karenina in an agitated whisper .
He gazed at the cross , then at the stars , drank in the fresh freezing air that flowed evenly into the room , and followed as though in a dream the images and memories that rose in his imagination .
Vronsky looked round angrily , but his face lighted up immediately with his characteristic expression of genial and manly serenity .
The husband of Princess Betsy , a good @-@ natured fat man , an ardent collector of engravings , hearing that his wife had visitors , came into the drawing @-@ room before going to his club .
&quot; Oh , dear !
The first telegram was the announcement of Stremov &apos;s appointment to the very post Karenin had coveted .
&quot; Here she is , &quot; she added , looking out of the window at the handsome Italian nurse , who was carrying the child out into the garden , and immediately glancing unnoticed at Vronsky .
From the theater Stepan Arkadyevitch drove to Ohotny Row , selected himself the fish and asparagus for dinner , and by twelve o &apos;clock was at Dussots , &quot; where he had to see three people , luckily all staying at the same hotel : Levin , who had recently come back from abroad and was staying there ; the new head of his department , who had just been promoted to that position , and had come on a tour of revision to Moscow ; and his brother @-@ in @-@ law , Karenin , whom he must see , so as to be sure of bringing him to dinner .
&quot; But I hope , count , you would not consent to live in the country always , &quot; said Countess Nordston .
He tried to clutch at the edge of the table , dropped the revolver , staggered , and sat down on the ground , looking about him in astonishment .
Vronsky saw nothing and no one .
Seeing that the woman standing in the doorway was moving to go , he shouted to her , &quot; Wait a minute , I said . &quot; And with the inability to express himself , the incoherence that Konstantin knew so well , he began , with another look round at everyone , to tell his brother Kritsky &apos;s story : how he had been expelled from the university for starting a benefit society for the poor students and Sunday schools ; and how he had afterwards been a teacher in a peasant school , and how he had been driven out of that too , and had afterwards been condemned for something .
Stepan Arkadyevitch advised him to go abroad .
There was no time to lose .
&quot; Oh , I know nothing about it ; I only said what I should like , &quot; he said apologetically .
And immediately after this came the delicious , slow saunter , with his hand on the scythe , during which he could wipe away the streaming sweat , take deep breaths of air , and look about at the long string of mowers and at what was happening around in the forest and the country .
Meanwhile there took place below , in the prince &apos;s little library , one of the scenes so often repeated between the parents on account of their favorite daughter .
The Russian fashion of matchmaking by the offices of intermediate persons was for some reason considered unseemly ; it was ridiculed by everyone , and by the princess herself .
Anna Arkadyevna , with her quick little hand , was unfastening the lace of her sleeve , caught in the hook of her fur cloak , and with bent head listening to the words Vronsky murmured as he escorted her down .
Can one talk of love in these days ? &quot; said the ambassador &apos;s wife .
And it &apos;s all through women .
But without this occupation , the life of Vronsky and of Anna , who wondered at his loss of interest in it , struck them as intolerably tedious in an Italian town .
And , thanks to this circumstance , she did not carry out her threat to her husband - that is to say , she remembered that her sister @-@ in @-@ law was coming .
Pride , they say .
Konstantin Levin did not like talking and hearing about the beauty of nature .
Rousing himself , Levin got up from the haycock , and looking at the stars , he saw that the night was over .
She laid down the book and sank against the back of the chair , tightly gripping the paper @-@ cutter in both hands .
That pang was intensified by the strange feeling of physical pity for her set up by her tears .
Mariette says he has been very good , And ...
&quot; Do you suppose I can doubt it ?
All constraint with the master had disappeared long ago .
&quot; I am very grateful to you for your confidence , but .... &quot; he said , feeling with confusion and annoyance that what he could decide easily and clearly by himself , he could not discuss before Princess Tverskaya , who to him stood for the incarnation of that brute force which would inevitably control him in the life he led in the eyes of the world , and hinder him from giving way to his feeling of love and forgiveness .
&quot; Yes , inform her .
These two men were so akin , so near each other , that the slightest gesture , the tone of voice , told both more than could be said in words .
Doubt between you and Vronsky .
&quot; They &apos;re all people , all men , like us poor sinners ; why be nasty and quarrelsome ? &quot; he thought as he went into the hotel .
But once more _ merci , _ my dear , for giving me a day .
But a girl is not asked .
&quot; Then we shall see , &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch said to himself , and getting up he put on a gray dressing @-@ gown lined with blue silk , tied the tassels in a knot , and , drawing a deep breath of air into his broad , bare chest , he walked to the window with his usual confident step , turning out his feet that carried his full frame so easily .
Anna smiled .
Her mouth stiffened , the muscles of the cheek contracted on the right side of her pale , nervous face .
&quot; Seryozha , &quot; she said , as soon as the governess had left the room , &quot; that was wrong , but you &apos;ll never do it again , will you ? ...
what &apos;s to be done ? &quot; he said in despair .
But he did not suspect that the chief cause of it was the word - _ son _ , which she could not bring herself to pronounce .
There turned out to be only thirty @-@ two loads in the stack .
It was nine o &apos;clock when he reached the Shtcherbatskys &quot; steps the second time .
Kitty felt that in her , in her manner of life , she would find an example of what she was now so painfully seeking : interest in life , a dignity in life - apart from the worldly relations of girls with men , which so revolted Kitty , and appeared to her now as a shameful hawking about of goods in search of a purchaser .
Tanya !
The eyes and the smile of Stepan Arkadyevitch showed Levin that he comprehended that feeling fittingly .
&quot; Sit down !
He told Stiva so . &quot; &quot; Well , what then ?
He opened his mouth .
&quot; What wicked gossip were you talking over there ? &quot; asked Betsy .
I &apos;m going through my wardrobe to see what &apos;s for whom .... &quot; &quot; Oh !
And so the princess was more uneasy over Kitty than she had been over her elder sisters .
&quot; What next !
And that one ?
And I began asking myself what it meant .
The government clerk with the sausages begins to melt , but he , too , desires to express his sentiments , and as soon as ever he begins to express them , he begins to get hot and say nasty things , and again I &apos;m obliged to trot out all my diplomatic talents .
They talked of Mihailov and his pictures .
When the peasants , with their singing , had vanished out of sight and hearing , a weary feeling of despondency at his own isolation , his physical inactivity , his alienation from this world , came over Levin .
&quot; Is this Grisha ?
Her hand had convulsively clutched her fan , and she held her breath .
But the words were spoken , and Alexey Alexandrovitch had gone away without saying anything .
And he too , most likely , had an Agafea Mihalovna to whom he confided his secrets . &quot; Musing on such thoughts Levin reached home in the darkness .
Levin arrived in Moscow always excited and in a hurry , rather ill at ease and irritated by his own want of ease , and for the most part with a perfectly new , unexpected view of things .
&quot; I feel it &apos;s selfishness on my part , and I am going away . &quot; She got up , but Anna , suddenly flushing , quickly caught at her hand .
Kitty had not seen him since the evening she refused Levin .
If only she doesn &apos;t take it into her head to console me ! &quot; thought Dolly .
Every week he thought less often of Kitty .
This post he had received through his sister Anna &apos;s husband , Alexey Alexandrovitch Karenin , who held one of the most important positions in the ministry to whose department the Moscow office belonged .
He heard Agafea Mihalovna talking of how Prohor had forgotten his duty to God , and with the money Levin had given him to buy a horse , had been drinking without stopping , and had beaten his wife till he &apos;d half killed her .
&quot; Why didn &apos;t you turn up at the Red Theater yesterday ?
To decline the flattering and dangerous appointment at Tashkend would have been , Vronsky had till then considered , disgraceful and impossible .
&quot; Yes , you see this woman , Marya Nikolaevna , did not know how to manage all this , &quot; said Levin .
The question whether to retire from the service or not brought him to the other and perhaps the chief though hidden interest of his life , of which none knew but he .
&quot; In adopting this course , I am not casting off a guilty wife , but giving her a chance of amendment ; and , indeed , difficult as the task will be to me , I shall devote part of my energies to her reformation and salvation . &quot; Though Alexey Alexandrovitch was perfectly aware that he could not exert any moral influence over his wife , that such an attempt at reformation could lead to nothing but falsity ; though in passing through these difficult moments he had not once thought of seeking guidance in religion , yet now , when his conclusion corresponded , as it seemed to him , with the requirements of religion , this religious sanction to his decision gave him complete satisfaction , and to some extent restored his peace of mind .
&quot; Yes , I imagine that divorce - yes , divorce , &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch repeated , reddening .
Yes , and capons , perhaps , and then sweets . &quot; The Tatar , recollecting that it was Stepan Arkadyevitch &apos;s way not to call the dishes by the names in the French bill of fare , did not repeat them after him , but could not resist rehearsing the whole menu to himself according to the bill : - &quot; _ Soupe printanière , turbot , sauce Beaumarchais , poulard à l &apos;estragon , macédoine de fruits _ ... etc . , &quot; and then instantly , as though worked by springs , laying down one bound bill of fare , he took up another , the list of wines , and submitted it to Stepan Arkadyevitch .
&quot; Ah !
Roland and her smile . )
In spite of the magnificent harvest , never had there been , or , at least , never it seemed to him , had there been so many hindrances and so many quarrels between him and the peasants as that year , and the origin of these failures and this hostility was now perfectly comprehensible to him .
Seriously , let &apos;s go by the five o &apos;clock !
&quot; I don &apos;t know him , I don &apos;t think of him .
&quot; Did you know her before her illness , prince - that &apos;s to say before she took to her bed ? &quot; &quot; Yes .
Splendid !
We have eyes for such things , though women @-@ folk haven &apos;t .
After the customary questions , whether they desired to enter upon matrimony , and whether they were pledged to anyone else , and their answers , which sounded strange to themselves , a new ceremony began .
He groaned and sank into an armchair .
He was not to blame for having been born with his unbridled temperament and his somehow limited intelligence .
&quot; I ?
&quot; Yes , you have conquered me , and I am yours , &quot; she said at last , pressing his hands to her bosom .
Seizing the first moment of silence , Levin got up , anxious to escape , if only for an instant , from his agonizing emotion , and said that he would go and fetch his wife .
&quot; It &apos;s terribly strange , &quot; she said to herself .
This was Madame Stahl .
You may , but I can &apos;t ! &quot; And saying these words she glanced at her sister , and seeing that Dolly sat silent , her head mournfully bowed , Kitty , instead of running out of the room as she had meant to do , sat down near the door , and hid her face in her handkerchief .
Darya Alexandrovna , hearing a scream in the nursery , ran in and saw a terrible sight .
After tea he went out into the hall to order his horses to be put in , and , when he came back , he found Darya Alexandrovna greatly disturbed , with a troubled face , and tears in her eyes .
Yes , &quot; said Anna .
Darya Alexandrovna had seen that as soon as he glanced into her face ; and she felt sorry for him , and her faith in the innocence of her friend began to totter .
What did it all matter ?
But Nikolay , who lay there breathing with what was left of lungs , had had a strong , healthy body too .
While Betsy was pouring out the tea , Vronsky went up to Anna .
&quot; But are they fully known ? &quot; Sergey Ivanovitch put in with a subtle smile .
Both the laborers were sitting in the hedge , probably smoking a pipe together .
&quot; Anna , for God &apos;s sake don &apos;t speak like that ! &quot; he said gently .
I know you for an excellent , upright man ; I know Anna - excuse me , I can &apos;t change my opinion of her - for a good , an excellent woman ; and so , excuse me , I cannot believe it .
There was a great deal of drinking .
And that was what Kitty longed to be .
Here , take the telegram ; give it to her , and then do what she tells you . &quot; &quot; You want to try it on , &quot; Matvey understood , but he only said , &quot; Yes , sir . &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch was already washed and combed and ready to be dressed , when Matvey , stepping deliberately in his creaky boots , came back into the room with the telegram in his hand .
Without referring to what he had believed in half an hour before , as though ashamed even to recall it , he asked for iodine to inhale in a bottle covered with perforated paper .
&quot; But just a glass for company . &quot; Over their tea Levin heard all about the old man &apos;s farming .
Because it was all a sham !
&quot; Ah !
&quot; Is it possible I can go over there on the ice , go up to her ? &quot; he thought .
That he knew long ago , but it could not be applied to his case .
And that he was not disposed to do .
&quot; But I &apos;m not speaking of other people , I &apos;m speaking of myself . &quot; &quot; Kitty , &quot; they heard her mother &apos;s voice , &quot; come here , show papa your necklace . &quot; Kitty , with a haughty air , without making peace with her friend , took the necklace in a little box from the table and went to her mother .
He may be cold , and dressed in rags , and ashamed , but he is not unhappy .
For Levin it was the chief affair of life , on which its whole happiness turned .
He could not help observing this .
&quot; Well , where are they ? &quot; &quot; Where are they ?
Vronsky knew that radiant air , and immediately observed it in Serpuhovskoy .
There was no one in the avenue ; but looking round to the right he caught sight of her .
He saw how the old cook smiled , admiring her , and listening to her inexperienced , impossible orders , how mournfully and tenderly Agafea Mihalovna shook her head over the young mistress &apos;s new arrangements .
But the question of whether my wife can or cannot see anyone she must decide herself . &quot; He said this from habit , lifting his brows with dignity , and reflected immediately that whatever his words might be , there could be no dignity in his position .
Not a week goes by without some scandal .
From the _ opera bouffe _ .
The cowhouse for the more valuable cows was just behind the house .
you &apos;re going ?
&quot; And you may say good @-@ bye to bear @-@ hunting for the future - your wife won &apos;t allow it ! &quot; Levin smiled .
She took her in her arms and kissed her .
&quot; Count Vronsky , &quot; said Anna .
There was bitterness , there was shame in his heart , but with bitterness and shame he felt joy and emotion at the height of his own meekness .
He made up his mind that he must speak of it to his wife .
I should imagine , though , she might reckon on a better match , &quot; said Vronsky , drawing himself up and walking about again , &quot; though I don &apos;t know him , of course , &quot; he added .
Happiness is the matter with me ! &quot; said Levin , letting down the window of the carriage they were driving in .
&quot; No , wait a minute , please .
It was an exquisite morning .
Agafea Mihalovna , always very anxious for the credit of the house , met him in the hall with inquiries about dinner .
I know mothers are partial , but .... &quot; &quot; What did his mother tell you ? &quot; &quot; Oh , a great deal !
&quot; She &apos;s very sweet , and I always liked her , &quot; said Anna .
The inequality in marriage , in his opinion , lay in the fact that the infidelity of the wife and the infidelity of the husband are punished unequally , both by the law and by public opinion .
you killed him ? &quot; cried Stepan Arkadyevitch .
&quot; Really , if I were not fond of you , I should feel offended .
&quot; No need of anything , &quot; she said to herself , and closing her blotting @-@ case she went upstairs , told the governess and the servants that she was going that day to Moscow , and at once set to work to pack up her things .
She turned round on her chair , flushed crimson , and rapidly moving her fingers , pinched the clasp of her belt first with one hand and then with the other .
&quot; Tell him everything , and leave him . &quot; &quot; Very well , let us suppose I do that , &quot; she said .
All you Levins are savages . &quot; Levin sighed .
&quot; Someone , your excellency , crept in without permission directly my back was turned .
But you said just now .... &quot; &quot; That &apos;s to say , I don &apos;t admit it &apos;s being either good or possible . &quot; &quot; That you can &apos;t tell without making the trial . &quot; &quot; Well , supposing that &apos;s so , &quot; said Levin , though he did not suppose so at all , &quot; supposing that is so , still I don &apos;t see , all the same , what I &apos;m to worry myself about it for . &quot; &quot; How so ? &quot; &quot; No ; since we are talking , explain it to me from the philosophical point of view , &quot; said Levin .
&quot; She may come to her senses , and only when she is being married realize that she does not and cannot love me . &quot; And strange , most evil thoughts of her began to come to him .
Kedrov really can &apos;t fight the gentleman !
Trying not to offend the other sledge drivers , and promising to drive with them too , Levin took one and told him to drive to the Shtcherbatskys . &quot;
&quot; My God !
Even Varenka struck her as different .
&quot; That merely proves either that I &apos;m a bad manager , or that I &apos;ve sunk my capital for the increase of my rents . &quot; &quot; Oh , rent ! &quot; Levin cried with horror .
Let &apos;s start off this instant to Tver !
Levin did not agree with Pestsov , nor with his brother , who had a special attitude of his own , both admitting and not admitting the significance of the Russian commune .
She had got ready to see him alone , and had been delighted at the idea , and had been shy and ashamed , and did not know herself what she was doing .
&quot; I know something .
She was conscious herself that her delight sparkled in her eyes and curved her lips into a smile , and she could not quench the expression of this delight .
That &apos;s first @-@ rate . &quot; And Levin went off to change his clothes .
The maid , stupefied , carries in their messages .
Madame Stahl called her Varenka , and other people called her &quot; Mademoiselle Varenka . &quot; Apart from the interest Kitty took in this girl &apos;s relations with Madame Stahl and with other unknown persons , Kitty , as often happened , felt an inexplicable attraction to Mademoiselle Varenka , and was aware when their eyes met that she too liked her .
Somehow or other these women are still looked on with contempt by them , and do not touch on their feeling for their family .
But Nikolay knew that this was just what he meant to say , and scowling he took up the vodka again .
What do I know about it ?
&quot; For me there are some less dull and tiresome . &quot; &quot; How can _ you _ be dull at a ball ? &quot; &quot; Why should not _ I _ be dull at a ball ? &quot; inquired Anna .
Petritsky , whom he liked , was implicated in the affair , and the other culprit was a capital fellow and first @-@ rate comrade , who had lately joined the regiment , the young Prince Kedrov .
She shook her head , not answering .
And most of all that look of confusion and tenderness !
He was a new admirer of Sappho &apos;s .
&quot; No , I always go about alone and nothing ever happens to me , &quot; she said , taking her hat .
But if once one allows the possibility of making of all the past a _ tabula rasa _ - no property , no family - then labor would organize itself .
&quot; No .
I absolutely had to see you , &quot; she said ; and the serious and set line of her lips , which he saw under the veil , transformed his mood at once .
All this was well enough , and the princess had nothing to say against it , especially as Petrov &apos;s wife was a perfectly nice sort of woman , and that the German princess , noticing Kitty &apos;s devotion , praised her , calling her an angel of consolation .
&quot; Well , how are you ?
Ah , how awful ! &quot; he said .
She recalled the efforts she had made at first to overcome the repugnance she felt for him , as for all consumptive people , and the pains it had cost her to think of things to say to him .
A few minutes later the colonel overtook them .
&quot; Delighted !
Levin , on the other hand , would have liked to get home as soon as possible to give orders about getting together the mowers for next day , and to set at rest his doubts about the mowing , which greatly absorbed him .
You wait a bit , and you &apos;ll come to this yourself .
She drew one more deep breath of the fresh air , and had just put her hand out of her muff to take hold of the door post and get back into the carriage , when another man in a military overcoat , quite close beside her , stepped between her and the flickering light of the lamp post .
He felt himself vanquished on all sides , but he felt at the same time that what he wanted to say was unintelligible to his brother .
&quot; Leave your husband and make our life one . &quot; &quot; It is one as it is , &quot; she answered , scarcely audibly .
take me to him ; it will be easier for us to bear it together .
He knew what was passing in Levin &apos;s soul .
&quot; Rent there may be in Europe , where land has been improved by the labor put into it , but with us all the land is deteriorating from the labor put into it - in other words they &apos;re working it out ; so there &apos;s no question of rent . &quot; &quot; How no rent ?
If he had been asked how long he had been working he would have said half an hour - and it was getting on for dinner time .
It &apos;s a confession that weighs on me ; I want to make it to you , &quot; said Anna , letting herself drop definitely into an armchair , and looking straight into Dolly &apos;s face .
&quot; No , &quot; he said to himself , &quot; however good that life of simplicity and toil may be , I cannot go back to it .
The sight of other people , their remarks , his own reminiscences , everything was for him a source of agony .
He &apos;ll flog them in the good old style !
That humiliation of which she was always conscious came back to her with a peculiar bitterness when her sister reminded her of it .
Mihailov fancied that the picture had made an impression on them too .
The dresses had to be altered so that they could not be recognized , and they ought to have been ready three days before .
When Stepan Arkadyevitch had gone down in the spring to sell the forest , Dolly had begged him to look over the house and order what repairs might be needed .
You &apos;re both wrong .
Having finished all his business , soaked through with the streams of water which kept running down the leather behind his neck and his gaiters , but in the keenest and most confident temper , Levin returned homewards in the evening .
It was simply interesting that it had been proved to be so and so .
&quot; Here , on the other hand , it has made a great sensation , &quot; he said , with a complacent smile .
&quot; I &apos;ve long wanted to ask you one thing . &quot; He looked straight into her caressing , though frightened eyes .
oh dear , oh dear !
&quot; Yes , I hear it , &quot; answered Levin , reluctantly breaking the stillness with his voice , which sounded disagreeable to himself .
Why , as &quot; tis , they &apos;re saying , &quot; Your master will be getting some honor from the Tsar for it . &quot; Indeed and it is a strange thing ; why need you worry about the peasants ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worrying about them ; I &apos;m doing it for my own good . &quot; Agafea Mihalovna knew every detail of Levin &apos;s plans for his land .
Well , in that case , to be sure , let them go .
The hero of the novel was already almost reaching his English happiness , a baronetcy and an estate , and Anna was feeling a desire to go with him to the estate , when she suddenly felt that _ he _ ought to feel ashamed , and that she was ashamed of the same thing .
Some members , with Stremov at their head , justified their mistake on the ground that they had put faith in the commission of revision , instituted by Alexey Alexandrovitch , and maintained that the report of the commission was rubbish , and simply so much waste paper .
He saw that the inmost recesses of her soul , that had always hitherto lain open before him , were closed against him .
&quot; Very well , later , but you must certainly tell me .
Noticing the disagreeable impression that was being made on everyone , Princess Betsy slipped someone else into her place to listen to Alexey Alexandrovitch , and went up to Anna .
But if it affords you satisfaction to gaze at Thérèse in the attire of Eve .... &quot; &quot; Again , the devil again , &quot; Vronsky said , taking the hand she had laid on the table and kissing it .
Vronsky was everywhere where he had any chance of meeting Anna , and speaking to her , when he could , of his love .
&quot; I don &apos;t know that it did me any good . &quot; &quot; No ; I imagine , joking apart , that to know love , one must make mistakes and then correct them , &quot; said Princess Betsy .
Sergey Ivanovitch waited serenely to speak , obviously with a convincing reply ready .
She did not look round , but the high scalloped collar , that reached her little pink ear , trembled faintly .
They were criticizing the Karenins , husband and wife .
&quot; We are not going , &quot; she said to Annushka , as she came in .
The hand reached it .
But she had in the highest degree the quality that makes all defects forgotten : that quality was _ blood _ , the blood _ that tells _ , as the English expression has it .
He &apos;s grown .
She made no answer , and in her face he saw conflict .
And so you maintain that the laborer himself is an element to be studied and to regulate the choice of methods in agriculture .
Seeing Levin , he shouted to him : &quot; Ah , the first skater in Russia !
&quot; It &apos;s too much for me , &quot; responded Levin .
&quot; I can introduce him to Anna , he looks at it properly . &quot; During those three months that Vronsky had spent abroad with Anna , he had always on meeting new people asked himself how the new person would look at his relations with Anna , and for the most part , in men , he had met with the &quot; proper &quot; way of looking at it .
&quot; Am I right , that you have some reminiscences connected with that song ? &quot; said Kitty .
&quot; No ; tell me , what was it ? &quot; he said , sitting down beside her and watching the tiny scissors moving round .
&quot; It &apos;s ten or eleven years since I had the honor of seeing you . &quot; &quot; Yes ; God sends the cross and sends the strength to bear it .
When she woke up next morning the first thing that rose to her mind was what she had said to her husband , and those words seemed to her so awful that she could not conceive now how she could have brought herself to utter those strange , coarse words , and could not imagine what would come of it .
These wounds never healed .
They mowed two more rows ; the old man stopped .
&quot; It was very , very early in the morning .
It &apos;s a productive association .... &quot; Konstantin scarcely heard him .
&quot; Not a bit of it , sir ; mow in the rain , and you &apos;ll rake in fine weather ! &quot; said the old man .
She went up to them , entered into conversation with them , and served as interpreter for the woman , who could not speak any foreign language .
I am crushed .
But when he took her face in both his hands and said &quot; Kitty ! &quot; she suddenly recovered herself , and began to cry , and they were reconciled .
Terrible as it was to Levin to put his arms round that terrible body , to take hold of that under the quilt , of which he preferred to know nothing , under his wife &apos;s influence he made his resolute face that she knew so well , and putting his arms into the bed took hold of the body , but in spite of his own strength he was struck by the strange heaviness of those powerless limbs .
What did the justice do ?
I don &apos;t understand .
&quot; Yes , as you see , your tender spouse , as devoted as the first year after marriage , burned with impatience to see you , &quot; he said in his deliberate , high @-@ pitched voice , and in that tone which he almost always took with her , a tone of jeering at anyone who should say in earnest what he said .
&quot; Your brother may feel proud of himself .
&quot; This way , your excellency , please .
&quot; I saw you when you were driving from the railway station to Ergushovo . &quot; &quot; When ? &quot; she asked , wondering .
Princess Betsy came to her rescue .
They were in the little boudoir .
Taking the crowns off their heads the priest read the last prayer and congratulated the young people .
And it had become a sort of game among them to sit a close as possible to their aunt , to touch her , hold her little hand , kiss it , play with her ring , or even touch the flounce of her skirt .
&quot; Now , gentlemen .... &quot; And the sitting of the board began .
O Lord , our God , who hast poured down the blessings of Thy Truth according to Thy Holy Covenant upon Thy chosen servants , our fathers , from generation to generation , bless Thy servants Konstantin and Ekaterina , and make their troth fast in faith , and union of hearts , and truth , and love .... &quot; Levin felt more and more that all his ideas of marriage , all his dreams of how he would order his life , were mere childishness , and that it was something he had not understood hitherto , and now understood less than ever , though it was being performed upon him .
&quot; Yes , there were reasons why he could not help being either particularly happy or particularly unhappy . &quot; Vronsky stood still and asked directly : &quot; How so ?
The Russian girl looked after Madame Stahl , and besides that , she was , as Kitty observed , on friendly terms with all the invalids who were seriously ill , and there were many of them at the springs , and looked after them in the most natural way .
We have our business and they have theirs , and they must make their profit .
He was indeed the person chiefly responsible for the chill benumbing all the guests before Stepan Arkadyevitch came in .
&quot; This is one of my most faithful supporters , &quot; said Korsunsky , bowing to Anna Arkadyevna , whom he had not yet seen .
But this was a mistake ; she almost completely missed the meaning of the words of the service ; she had not heard them , in fact .
&quot; I &apos;m not defending him , it &apos;s nothing to me ; but I imagine , if you had not cared for those pleasures yourself , you might have got out of them .
&quot; My God !
At first Levin , in answer to Kitty &apos;s question how he could have seen her last year in the carriage , told her how he had been coming home from the mowing along the highroad and had met her .
Give me the money . &quot; &quot; Never mind ; you tell them I &apos;ll pay the bill ! &quot; and he vanished , nodding genially to an acquaintance who drove by .
It is true that Shuraev would have liked to let out the kitchen gardens he had undertaken in small lots to the peasants .
And now among all his acquaintances he had not one friend .
I wanted to run away , but he bent down over a sack , and was fumbling there with his hands .... &quot; She showed how he had moved his hands .
&quot; What an exquisite thing !
You have not listened to me .
&quot; Nikolay Dmitrievitch , Nikolay Dmitrievitch , &quot; whispered Marya Nikolaevna , again going up to him .
&quot; Oh , I stayed in Germany , in Prussia , in France , and in England - not in the capitals , but in the manufacturing towns , and saw a great deal that was new to me .
&quot; Are you cold ?
Stepan Arkadyevitch was standing at the top of the stairs .
Chapter 21 Dolly came out of her room to the tea of the grown @-@ up people .
He could now think calmly of Alexey Alexandrovitch .
Levin rode back across the streams , hoping the water would have gone down .
Crushed ! ... &quot; was heard among the crowd .
You might go &quot; - she turned to Tushkevitch - &quot; with Masha , and try the croquet ground over there where they &apos;ve been cutting it .
&quot; That &apos;s how it always is ! &quot; Sergey Ivanovitch interrupted him .
Still unable to realize what had happened , Vronsky tugged at his mare &apos;s reins .
Towards evening he was always drunk , and he had often been locked up after all sorts of ludicrous and disgraceful scandals , but he was a favorite both of his comrades and his superior officers .
But now , from a feeling readily comprehensible to officials - that hatred felt by one who has suffered a defeat in the service for one who has received a promotion , he could not endure him .
The door opened and Kitty appeared .
And he turned to what seemed to him the very source of culture - the magazines .
Levin yielded with a sinking heart : yes , he drew it to his mouth and kissed it .
He did not recognize his room , looking up from the ground , at the bent legs of the table , at the wastepaper basket , and the tiger @-@ skin rug .
Chapter 34 When Vronsky went to Moscow from Petersburg , he had left his large set of rooms in Morskaia to his friend and favorite comrade Petritsky .
At the works , for instance , they pocketed the advance @-@ money and made off .
Don &apos;t interrupt me ! &quot; and she made haste to speak .
Isn &apos;t she a clever thing ? &quot; he said , taking the warm bird from Laska &apos;s mouth and packing it into the almost full game bag .
I have quarreled with them all , and don &apos;t go to the meetings any more , &quot; he said , turning to Oblonsky .
Formerly this work had been for him an escape from life .
I don &apos;t think I did anything , &quot; she said .
&quot; Oh , so it &apos;s not time to die yet ? &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , pressing Levin &apos;s hand with emotion .
&quot; Yes , &quot; she answered .
Won &apos;t you be there ? &quot; said Kitty , to try Varenka .
I &apos;ll give you a hundred guesses , a thousand ... you &apos;d never guess .
No , tell me how there can be a theory of rent ? ... &quot; &quot; Will you have some junket ?
And he knows all that ; he knows that I can &apos;t repent that I breathe , that I love ; he knows that it can lead to nothing but lying and deceit ; but he wants to go on torturing me .
&quot; So then there &apos;s no reason to speak of it ?
Everyone said she had lost her looks dreadfully of late , and was not nearly so pretty on her wedding day as usual ; but Levin did not think so .
&quot; What does he want to ask me about this at confession for ? &quot; he thought .
And besides , how can I now , after what Darya Alexandrovna told me , go to see them ?
You have never loved me ; you have neither heart nor honorable feeling !
and it &apos;s high time I did , and go to the devil with you !
I &apos;m glad we &apos;ve spoken openly .
One can walk round it , &quot; said Golenishtchev , unmistakably betraying by this remark that he did not approve of the meaning and idea of the figure .
&quot; Look &apos;ee now , master , once take hold of the rope there &apos;s no letting it go ! &quot; he said , and Levin heard smothered laughter among the mowers .
&quot; You said rights , &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch , waiting till Pestsov had finished , &quot; meaning the right of sitting on juries , of voting , of presiding at official meetings , the right of entering the civil service , of sitting in parliament .... &quot; &quot; Undoubtedly . &quot; &quot; But if women , as a rare exception , can occupy such positions , it seems to me you are wrong in using the expression &quot; rights . &quot; It would be more correct to say duties .
He &apos;s doing just what &apos;s characteristic of his mean character .
I see a chance of despair , of wretchedness ... or I see a chance of bliss , what bliss ! ...
In him , in his handsome , radiant figure , his sparkling eyes , black hair and eyebrows , and the white and red of his face , there was something which produced a physical effect of kindliness and good humor on the people who met him .
&quot; Is he killed or not ?
Most fortunate , &quot; he said to his wife , dismissing Vronsky altogether , &quot; that I should just have half an hour to meet you , so that I can prove my devotion , &quot; he went on in the same jesting tone .
Then the countess told her of more disagreements and intrigues against the work of the unification of the churches , and departed in haste , as she had that day to be at the meeting of some society and also at the Slavonic committee .
It &apos;s high time I should know the gentry .
The efforts of Agafea Mihalovna and the cook , that the dinner should be particularly good , only ended in the two famished friends attacking the preliminary course , eating a great deal of bread and butter , salt goose and salted mushrooms , and in Levin &apos;s finally ordering the soup to be served without the accompaniment of little pies , with which the cook had particularly meant to impress their visitor .
&quot; With vegetables in it , you know .
Chapter 22 The ball was only just beginning as Kitty and her mother walked up the great staircase , flooded with light , and lined with flowers and footmen in powder and red coats .
&quot; Oh , yes , what was it that was unpleasant ? &quot; he wondered .
&quot; Neither you nor I have looked on our relations as a passing amusement , and now our fate is sealed .
Levin smiled joyfully ; he was struck by this transition from the confused , verbose discussion with Pestsov and his brother to this laconic , clear , almost wordless communication of the most complex ideas .
But having once made up his mind he went on in his shrill voice , without timidity - or hesitation , accentuating here and there a word .
He looked on this spiritual exercise as a harmful and dangerous abuse of the fancy .
&quot; He &apos;s jealous , &quot; she thought .
&quot; Of course he was quite old , &quot; he said , and changed the subject .
&quot; How can you do it seriously ? &quot; &quot; Why not ? &quot; &quot; Why , because there &apos;s nothing in it . &quot; &quot; You think so , but we &apos;re overwhelmed with work . &quot; &quot; On paper .
The feeling of furious anger with his wife , who would not observe the proprieties and keep to the one stipulation he had laid on her , not to receive her lover in her own home , gave him no peace .
&quot; Oh , by the way , there &apos;s a letter for you , &quot; said he .
Come , how am I to tell you ? &quot; she went on , seeing the puzzled look in her sister &apos;s eyes .
&quot; No , sir .
I was to blame .
She knew as certainly as if he had told her that he was here to be where she was .
It may very well be , I repeat , that my words seem to you utterly unnecessary and out of place ; it may be that they are called forth by my mistaken impression .
That &apos;s why I like the Shtcherbatskys , &quot; that I &apos;m growing better .
&quot; That &apos;ll be enough . &quot; &quot; Enough or not enough , we must make it do , &quot; said Matvey , slamming the carriage door and stepping back onto the steps .
&quot; Do you know your little Vanya &apos;s with me , a clerk in the countinghouse at Pokrovskoe . &quot; Nikolay jerked his neck , and sank into thought .
Matvey was followed by the barber with all the necessaries for shaving .
What &apos;s wanted to prevent her taking her child to the hen @-@ roost to cure it of screaming fits is just .... &quot; Sviazhsky said , smiling good @-@ humoredly .
Alexey Alexandrovitch decided that he would go to Petersburg and see his wife .
Levin looked round at her , and was struck by the joyful radiance on her face , and unconsciously her feeling infected him .
&quot; I &apos;ve said it to you twenty times , don &apos;t enter into details .
&quot; Surely you must feel how easy it is for you to insult me ? &quot; she said .
The peasant got this done , and he could not say enough in praise of it as food for the beasts .
But he ( he knew very well how he must appear to others ) was a country gentleman , occupied in breeding cattle , shooting game , and building barns ; in other words , a fellow of no ability , who had not turned out well , and who was doing just what , according to the ideas of the world , is done by people fit for nothing else .
And he bent his long legs , swathed in tight riding breeches , and sat down in the chair , too low for him , so that his knees were cramped up in a sharp angle .
When he came back a few minutes later , Stepan Arkadyevitch was already in conversation with the countess about the new singer , while the countess was impatiently looking towards the door , waiting for her son .
But what &apos;s to be done ?
No one had heard him , and Konstantin , taking off his galoshes , listened to what the gentleman in the jerkin was saying .
And it actually seemed to him that he always had seen it : he recalled incidents of their past life , in which he had never seen anything wrong before - now these incidents proved clearly that she had always been a corrupt woman .
You are hateful to me , disgusting , a stranger - yes , a complete stranger ! &quot; With pain and wrath she uttered the word so terrible to herself - _ stranger _ .
&quot; Here you are at last ! &quot; she observed , holding out her hand to him .
How could a woman of any intelligence , of any delicacy , put her sister in such a humiliating position !
She owns it ! &quot; &quot; Then do this for me : never say such things to me , and let us be friends , &quot; she said in words ; but her eyes spoke quite differently .
He doesn &apos;t understand that she &apos;s one of those women who can &apos;t trifle with their feelings .
I &apos;m not that woman .
The old grass looked greener , and the young grass thrust up its tiny blades ; the buds of the guelder @-@ rose and of the currant and the sticky birch @-@ buds were swollen with sap , and an exploring bee was humming about the golden blossoms that studded the willow .
You won &apos;t ? &quot; &quot; Never , mamma , none , &quot; answered Kitty , flushing a little , and looking her mother straight in the face , &quot; but there &apos;s no use in my telling you anything , and I ...
I am fully persuaded that you have repented and do repent of what has called forth the present letter , and that you will cooperate with me in eradicating the cause of our estrangement , and forgetting the past .
He went into her room , and without greeting her , walked straight up to her writing @-@ table , and taking her keys , opened a drawer .
Vronsky was not merely acquainted with all the persons whom he was meeting here ; he saw them all every day ; and so he came in with the quiet manner with which one enters a room full of people from whom one has only just parted .
Vronsky was used to princes , but , either because he had himself changed of late , or that he was in too close proximity to the prince , that week seemed fearfully wearisome to him .
Now , when the thing &apos;s done , don &apos;t you see , can one possibly cast her off ?
Stepan Arkadyevitch was touched .
&quot; Daryalov fought a duel .... &quot; The duel had particularly fascinated the thoughts of Alexey Alexandrovitch in his youth , just because he was physically a coward , and was himself well aware of the fact .
She &apos;s such a splendid woman , isn &apos;t she ? &quot; &quot; They &apos;re not far from here , then ? &quot; &quot; Twenty @-@ five miles .
&quot; There , who &apos;d have thought it ? &quot; said Agafea Mihalovna .
He sat in his armchair , looking straight before him or scanning the people who got in and out .
He could not now reconcile his immediate past , his tenderness , his love for his sick wife , and for the other man &apos;s child with what was now the case , that is with the fact that , as it were , in return for all this he now found himself alone , put to shame , a laughing @-@ stock , needed by no one , and despised by everyone .
The sledge was high and comfortable , and altogether such a one as Levin never drove in after , and the horse was a good one , and tried to gallop but didn &apos;t seem to move .
&quot; It &apos;s all youthfulness - positively nothing but boyishness .
His burden is light , &quot; she said , with the look of ecstasy Alexey Alexandrovitch knew so well .
No one was better able to appreciate her grandeur than Levin .
I made inquiries in all directions . &quot; He had to talk so as not to be silent , and he did not know what to say , especially as his brother made no reply , and simply stared without dropping his eyes , and evidently penetrated to the inner meaning of each word .
&quot; Aha , young man ! &quot; was the greeting with which he met him .
Kitty got up to fetch a table , and as she passed , her eyes met Levin &apos;s .
&quot; Do come , do come !
Again in extraordinarily rapid succession his best moments rose before his mind , and then his recent humiliation .
But Stepan Arkadyevitch instinctively felt that everything would _ come round _ all right .
Frou @-@ Frou started into a gallop , her left foot forward , made two bounds , and fretting at the tightened reins , passed into a jolting trot , bumping her rider up and down .
&quot; But after all , while she was in the house , I kept myself in hand .
&quot; Ambition ?
&quot; I am like a hungry man who has been given food .
&quot; Ah , yes !
The young , sturdy @-@ looking son was telling something funny with his mouth full of pudding , and they were all laughing , the woman in the clogs , who was pouring cabbage soup into a bowl , laughing most merrily of all .
There &apos;s no help for it !
while divorce would solve the difficulty completely . &quot; With some effort Stepan Arkadyevitch brought out his central idea , and looked significantly at her .
&quot; How was it , then ?
And I shan &apos;t live through it .
_ Château des Fleurs _ ; there I shall find Oblonsky , songs , the cancan .
That feeling was joy at the completion of the process that for the last month and a half had been going on in her soul , and had during those six weeks been a joy and a torture to her .
Instantly flinging a fresh cloth over the round table under the bronze chandelier , though it already had a table cloth on it , he pushed up velvet chairs , and came to a standstill before Stepan Arkadyevitch with a napkin and a bill of fare in his hands , awaiting his commands .
Nikolay probably felt the same ; he began questioning his brother about his affairs ; and Levin was glad to talk about himself , because then he could speak without hypocrisy .
They tossed Serpuhovskoy in the air and caught him again several times .
Come , let us go ; I &apos;ll take you to your room , &quot; she said , getting up , and on the way she embraced Anna .
&quot; I told her I could not receive him . &quot; &quot; You said , my dear , that it would depend on Alexey Alexandrovitch , &quot; Betsy corrected her .
But three don &apos;t count ; he won &apos;t pay up . &quot; &quot; Oh , then you can afford to lose over me , &quot; said Vronsky , laughing .
Wasn &apos;t he to be at the council ? &quot; &quot; He had been and come back , and was going out somewhere again .
It &apos;s the young people have to marry ; and not their parents ; and so we ought to leave the young people to arrange it as they choose . &quot; It was very easy for anyone to say that who had no daughters , but the princess realized that in the process of getting to know each other , her daughter might fall in love , and fall in love with someone who did not care to marry her or who was quite unfit to be her husband .
At last , having duly performed the ceremony , having signed the rings with the cross , the priest handed Kitty the big ring , and Levin the little one .
All the hatred of that day when he had resolved on a divorce had sprung up again in his soul .
We &apos;ve found the secret Europe was seeking for !
He had no need to be strict with himself , as he had very quickly been brought down to the required light weight ; but still he had to avoid gaining flesh , and so he eschewed farinaceous and sweet dishes .
And little groups and solitary figures among the public began running from place to place to get a better view .
Alexey had said at the time to his brother that that sum would be sufficient for him until he married , which he probably never would do .
But he knew that by the etiquette of the race course it was not merely impossible for him to see the horse , but improper even to ask questions about him .
Sergey Ivanovitch was all the while admiring the beauty of the woods , which were a tangled mass of leaves , pointing out to his brother now an old lime tree on the point of flowering , dark on the shady side , and brightly spotted with yellow stipules , now the young shoots of this year &apos;s saplings brilliant with emerald .
It was a set made up of elderly , ugly , benevolent , and godly women , and clever , learned , and ambitious men .
You &apos;re alive , but I &apos;m bored . &quot; &quot; How can you be bored ?
Was it worth it ?
But in the Oblonskys &quot; household , as in all families indeed , there was one inconspicuous but most valuable and useful person , Marya Philimonovna .
And while he did this he kept looking about and watching what came into his view : at one moment he picked a wild berry and ate it or offered it to Levin , then he flung away a twig with the blade of the scythe , then he looked at a quail &apos;s nest , from which the bird flew just under the scythe , or caught a snake that crossed his path , and lifting it on the scythe as though on a fork showed it to Levin and threw it away .
Putting his hand to the peak of his cap , he bowed to her and asked , Was there anything she wanted ?
Why one ought to have confidence - that is to say , complete conviction that his young wife would always love him - he did not ask himself .
She laid down the opera @-@ glass , and would have moved away , but at that moment an officer galloped up and made some announcement to the Tsar .
do you know brother Nikolay &apos;s turned up again ? &quot; This brother Nikolay was the elder brother of Konstantin Levin , and half @-@ brother of Sergey Ivanovitch ; a man utterly ruined , who had dissipated the greater part of his fortune , was living in the strangest and lowest company , and had quarreled with his brothers .
When she came to herself , she saw that she was holding her hair in both hands , each side of her temples , and pulling it .
There was probably something unusual about Anna , for Betsy noticed it at once .
Stepan Arkadyevitch took the letter , looked with incredulous surprise at the lusterless eyes fixed so immovably on him , and began to read .
&quot; No , &quot; she cried , on seeing him , and at the first sound of her voice the tears came into her eyes .
Though it was hard work to look after all the children and restrain their wild pranks , though it was difficult too to keep in one &apos;s head and not mix up all the stockings , little breeches , and shoes for the different legs , and to undo and to do up again all the tapes and buttons , Darya Alexandrovna , who had always liked bathing herself , and believed it to be very good for the children , enjoyed nothing so much as bathing with all the children .
As they were going out of the drawing @-@ room to conclude the argument , Koznishev said , smiling : &quot; So , then , for the Russification of our foreign populations there is but one method - to bring up as many children as one can .
No money at all .
But one fact was indubitable - she was in amicable relations with the highest dignitaries of all the churches and sects .
And the poor darling , ruined mare !
Now she knew all of them as people know one another in a country town ; she knew their habits and weaknesses , and where the shoe pinched each one of them .
He began warmly contesting the justice of this view .
But , besides that , her emotion physically affected him in the same way .
His wife &apos;s words , confirming his worst suspicions , had sent a cruel pang to the heart of Alexey Alexandrovitch .
&quot; I guess , but I can &apos;t be the first to talk about it .
But the difference was that Oblonsky , as he was doing the same as everyone did , laughed complacently and good @-@ humoredly , while Levin laughed without complacency and sometimes angrily .
Besides , one keeps hoping the people will learn sense .
They both looked at the sun .
Happening to meet Shtcherbatsky , Kitty &apos;s cousin , in the railway train , Levin greatly astonished him by his depression .
&quot; You see what he writes !
And for us to suppose we can have something great - ideas , work - it &apos;s all dust and ashes . &quot; &quot; But all that &apos;s as old as the hills , my boy ! &quot; &quot; It is old ; but do you know , when you grasp this fully , then somehow everything becomes of no consequence .
If the same thing had been done , but with care that .... &quot; And he proceeded to unfold his own scheme of emancipation by means of which these drawbacks might have been avoided .
As he went in the door , the unknown voice was saying : &quot; It all depends with how much judgment and knowledge the thing &apos;s done . &quot; Konstantin Levin looked in at the door , and saw that the speaker was a young man with an immense shock of hair , wearing a Russian jerkin , and that a pockmarked woman in a woolen gown , without collar or cuffs , was sitting on the sofa .
He laughed aloud with delight .
Oh , nothing .
And he blamed himself now for having taken too little interest in him .
He would have covered the picture , but he stopped , holding the cloth in his hand , and , smiling blissfully , gazed a long while at the figure of John .
Only I don &apos;t know if they &apos;ll manage to get through ; it &apos;s so slushy . &quot; &quot; How many acres ? &quot; &quot; About fifteen . &quot; &quot; Why not sow all ? &quot; cried Levin .
It had turned out quite the other way .
In spite of these words and this smile , which so frightened Varya , when the inflammation was over and he began to recover , he felt that he was completely free from one part of his misery .
This definitely expressed purpose astonished Levin .
Vronsky forgot now all that he had thought on the way of the hardships and difficulties of their position .
His brow was lowering , and his eyes stared darkly before him , avoiding her eyes ; his mouth was tightly and contemptuously shut .
What &apos;s good for the master &apos;s good for us too .
&quot; But , anyway , it suits her .
As for this little Petersburg swell , they &apos;re turned out by machinery , all on one pattern , and all precious rubbish .
His honor comes to us too , &quot; he began , chatting , leaning his elbows on the railing of the steps .
Of course , from the point of view of Prokofy , seeing him in a torn cloak and tipsy , he &apos;s a despicable person .
Every man will agree that in doing the duty of a juryman , a witness , a telegraph clerk , we feel we are performing duties .
&quot; You &apos;re going home , so I &apos;ll go with you . &quot; And he walked out with Vronsky .
This did not interest Levin , but when he had finished , Levin went back to his first position , and , addressing Sviazhsky , and trying to draw him into expressing his serious opinion : - &quot; That the standard of culture is falling , and that with our present relations to the peasants there is no possibility of farming on a rational system to yield a profit - that &apos;s perfectly true , &quot; said he .
&quot; You may keep your books as you like , but if they spoil everything for you , there won &apos;t be any profit . &quot; &quot; Why do they spoil things ?
Can I help showing that I know what she told me ?
He wanted to finish the day at supper as pleasantly as it had been begun .
&quot; Tereshtchenko !
&quot; Thank God ! &quot; said Matvey , showing by this response that he , like his master , realized the significance of this arrival - that is , that Anna Arkadyevna , the sister he was so fond of , might bring about a reconciliation between husband and wife .
I wouldn &apos;t have said , &quot; Anna , _ ma chère _ &quot; !
Didn &apos;t you see her ? &quot; &quot; No , &quot; answered Vronsky , and without even glancing round towards the pavilion where his friend was pointing out Madame Karenina , he went up to his mare .
He had only just spoken to her , when suddenly he heard the rustle of a skirt at the door , and Mademoiselle Linon vanished from Levin &apos;s eyes , and a joyful terror came over him at the nearness of his happiness .
I wanted ... yes , I wanted to talk to you , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , with surprise aware of an unaccustomed timidity .
Consequently Vronsky had the right to despise Levin , and therefore he was his enemy .
The shooting turned out to be worse than Levin had expected .
Towards morning , there was a return again of excitement , rapid thought and talk , and again it ended in unconsciousness .
She kissed Anna , and went out .
I &apos;m glad to see you , anyway .
One thing he could not pluck out of his heart , though he never ceased struggling with it , was the regret , amounting to despair , that he had lost her forever .
He was even thinner than three years before , when Konstantin Levin had seen him last .
And I &apos;ll go to Rome ; there &apos;s a wilderness , and there I shall be no trouble to anyone , only I &apos;ll take Seryozha and the little one .... No , you can &apos;t forgive me !
&quot; On the table , &quot; replied Matvey , glancing with inquiring sympathy at his master ; and , after a short pause , he added with a sly smile , &quot; They &apos;ve sent from the carriage @-@ jobbers . &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch made no reply , he merely glanced at Matvey in the looking @-@ glass .
&quot; These new institutions , these justices of the peace , rural councils , what hideousness it all is ! &quot; And he began to enlarge on his encounters with the new institutions .
The familiar details came out : the stag &apos;s horns , the bookshelves , the looking @-@ glass , the stove with its ventilator , which had long wanted mending , his father &apos;s sofa , a large table , on the table an open book , a broken ashtray , a manuscript book with his handwriting .
Well , say what you will , we women feel for our sister . &quot; Such were the comments in the crowd of gazing women who had succeeded in slipping in at the church doors .
Unconsciously yielding to the weakness of Anna - who had surrendered herself up to him utterly , and simply looked to him to decide her fate , ready to submit to anything - he had long ceased to think that their tie might end as he had thought then .
I &apos;m happy , and my happiness can be no greater and no less for anything you do , &quot; he thought .
&quot; Yes , it was wonderful , noble ! &quot; said Dolly , glancing towards Turovtsin , who had become aware they were talking of him , and smiling gently to him .
Kitty blushed .
&quot; I must soon be getting ready for the races .
There was a struggle in his heart between the desire to forget his unhappy brother for the time , and the consciousness that it would be base to do so .
After saying good @-@ night to the ladies , and promising to stay the whole of the next day , so as to make an expedition on horseback with them to see an interesting ruin in the crown forest , Levin went , before going to bed , into his host &apos;s study to get the books on the labor question that Sviazhsky had offered him .
ah ! &quot; he sighed deeply .
I should not permit myself to express it so , speaking with a man of no education , &quot; he said , &quot; but I imagine that to you this is comprehensible . &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch was , however , so perturbed that he did not immediately comprehend all the good sense of adultery by mutual consent , and his eyes expressed this uncertainty ; but the lawyer promptly came to his assistance .
So good @-@ bye till then . &quot; &quot; Now mind , you &apos;ll forget , I know you , or rush off home to the country ! &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch called out laughing .
Chapter 11 Everyone took part in the conversation except Kitty and Levin .
Vronsky had gone home , but in the morning he came to inquire , and Alexey Alexandrovitch meeting him in the hall , said : &quot; Better stay , she might ask for you , &quot; and himself led him to his wife &apos;s boudoir .
&quot; I beg you , I entreat you , &quot; she said suddenly , taking his hand , and speaking in quite a different tone , sincere and tender , &quot; never speak to me of that ! &quot; &quot; But , Anna .... &quot; &quot; Never .
In the first place , the dispensary is needed .
Missed ! &quot; he said , fumbling after the revolver .
Whether it was that she had heard his words , or that she did not want to hear them , she made a sort of stumble , twice struck out , and hurriedly skated away from him .
For a few lengths they moved evenly .
This man lifted his straw hat , showed his scanty curly hair and high forehead , painfully reddened by the pressure of the hat .
Sviazhsky took out the books , and sat down in a rocking @-@ chair .
He kissed her hand and sat down beside her .
During the quadrille nothing of any significance was said : there was disjointed talk between them of the Korsunskys , husband and wife , whom he described very amusingly , as delightful children at forty , and of the future town theater ; and only once the conversation touched her to the quick , when he asked her about Levin , whether he was here , and added that he liked him so much .
&quot; What am I to do ?
He doesn &apos;t even know what love is . &quot; &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch , really I don &apos;t understand , &quot; she said .
Here , he feels in his proper place .
&quot; There , darling !
He said good @-@ bye to him at the station on their return from a bear hunt , at which they had had a display of Russian prowess kept up all night .
&quot; Delighted ! &quot; and he moved away towards his carriage .
Yes , I could forgive it .
I can understand compulsory military service , which affects my children , my brothers , and myself , I am ready to deliberate on what concerns me ; but deliberating on how to spend forty thousand roubles of district council money , or judging the half @-@ witted Alioshka - I don &apos;t understand , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot; Konstantin Levin spoke as though the floodgates of his speech had burst open .
Will that be all right ? &quot; said he , tightening the strap .
And often in their criticisms he fancied that he had found this .
I won &apos;t be a sham .
Yashvin , a gambler and a rake , a man not merely without moral principles , but of immoral principles , Yashvin was Vronsky &apos;s greatest friend in the regiment .
She took to her bed before my eyes , &quot; said the prince .
&quot; It is put up there to be sold , &quot; he answered , scowling gloomily .
tomorrow I shall see Seryozha and Alexey Alexandrovitch , and my life will go on in the old way , all nice and as usual . &quot; Still in the same anxious frame of mind , as she had been all that day , Anna took pleasure in arranging herself for the journey with great care .
&quot; He too has a philosophy of his own at the service of his natural tendencies , &quot; he thought .
Konstantin Levin had no definite and unalterable idea on the subject , and so in their arguments Konstantin was readily convicted of contradicting himself .
&quot; And so we &apos;re founding a locksmiths &quot; association , where all the production and profit and the chief instruments of production will be in common . &quot; &quot; Where is the association to be ? &quot; asked Konstantin Levin .
It seemed to her that , knowing this , he might sooner cease to love her ; and she dreaded nothing now so much as losing his love , though she had no grounds for fearing it .
If he had any feeling for his brother at that moment , it was envy for the knowledge the dying man had now that he could not have .
He went up to the top , turned back again and started mowing , and they all proceeded to form in line behind him , going downhill through the hollow and uphill right up to the edge of the forest .
But for Levin she was as easy to find in that crowd as a rose among nettles .
Matvey nodded at the looking @-@ glass .
And I &apos;m very glad for the peasant .
Can he love ?
Another row , and yet another row , followed - long rows and short rows , with good grass and with poor grass .
His lips were sternly compressed , and his eyes looked away from her .
&quot; I &apos;ve given my word , you know . &quot; Levin went out of the room , slamming the door .
He went up to her .
She seemed to be pulling herself together for a few seconds , as though she did not know where she was , and what she was doing , and getting up rapidly , she moved towards the door .
He visited the Karenins &quot; summer villa as rarely as possible .
It forms an integral part of the duties of an officer .
&quot; Yes , he &apos;s a decent fellow , and will look at the thing properly , &quot; Vronsky said to himself , catching the significance of Golenishtchev &apos;s face and the change of subject .
When they reached the house he helped her to get out of the carriage , and making an effort to master himself , took leave of her with his usual urbanity , and uttered that phrase that bound him to nothing ; he said that tomorrow he would let her know his decision .
And as he vividly pictured the happiness of seeing her , his face lighted up .
&quot; I cannot be your wife while I .... &quot; she began .
But now , thanks to his wife &apos;s presence , that feeling did not reduce him to despair .
How he has succeeded in it , and how simply !
Sviazhsky &apos;s study was a huge room , surrounded by bookcases and with two tables in it - one a massive writing @-@ table , standing in the middle of the room , and the other a round table , covered with recent numbers of reviews and journals in different languages , ranged like the rays of a star round the lamp .
&quot; Good morning , princess , &quot; said Anna Pavlovna , with an assumed smile utterly unlike her former manner .
Yes , and for three weeks he stopped with them , and looked after the children like a nurse . &quot; &quot; I am telling Konstantin Dmitrievitch about Turovtsin in the scarlet fever , &quot; she said , bending over to her sister .
The coachman , Terenty , fastened the horses , who kept whisking away the flies , to a tree , and , treading down the grass , lay down in the shade of a birch and smoked his shag , while the never @-@ ceasing shrieks of delight of the children floated across to him from the bathing @-@ place .
She would have been a good figure , too , if it had not been for her extreme thinness and the size of her head , which was too large for her medium height .
The men went into the dining @-@ room and went up to a table , laid with six sorts of spirits and as many kinds of cheese , some with little silver spades and some without , caviar , herrings , preserves of various kinds , and plates with slices of French bread .
Then the discussion began .
When , after Mahotin and Vronsky had cleared the worst barrier , the next officer had been thrown straight on his head at it and fatally injured , and a shudder of horror passed over the whole public , Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that Anna did not even notice it , and had some difficulty in realizing what they were talking of about her .
We in the country try to bring our hands into such a state as will be most convenient for working with .
Time will go by and I shall not mind about this either . &quot; But three months had passed and he had not left off minding about it ; and it was as painful for him to think of it as it had been those first days .
Chapter 15 They had just come back from Moscow , and were glad to be alone .
It &apos;s dirty and stinking here , I expect .
&quot; I understand , &quot; she said in a whisper .
&quot; I understand , dear friend , &quot; said Lidia Ivanovna .
I &apos;m going tomorrow . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a nice person !
&quot; Well , how &apos;s Frou @-@ Frou ? &quot; Vronsky asked in English .
&quot; What ? ...
And , so far from being simple , it all seemed to him utterly impossible .
&quot; Our host himself !
Whatever your conduct may have been , I do not consider myself justified in breaking the ties in which we are bound by a Higher Power .
In consequence of this , in the higher spheres , and even in society , all was chaos , and although everyone was interested , no one could tell whether the native tribes really were becoming impoverished and ruined , or whether they were in a flourishing condition .
&quot; Why , what ? &quot; &quot; Oh , so much that &apos;s more important , &quot; answered Varenka , not knowing what to say .
Oh , did you make the acquaintance of my friend Levin ? &quot; asked Stepan Arkadyevitch .
A man whose father crawled up from nothing at all by intrigue , and whose mother - God knows whom she wasn &apos;t mixed up with .... No , excuse me , but I consider myself aristocratic , and people like me , who can point back in the past to three or four honorable generations of their family , of the highest degree of breeding ( talent and intellect , of course that &apos;s another matter ) , and have never curried favor with anyone , never depended on anyone for anything , like my father and my grandfather .
Levin went home at a trot , so as to have time to eat his dinner and get his gun ready for the evening .
Levin was not a disreputable chum , but Oblonsky , with his ready tact , felt that Levin fancied he might not care to show his intimacy with him before his subordinates , and so he made haste to take him off into his room .
&quot; And send my scythe , please , to Tit , for him to set it , and bring it round tomorrow .
She saw that she was losing her good looks .
&quot; I have told my husband , &quot; she wrote , and she sat a long while unable to write more .
&quot; I have just sent for the doctor , &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch .
He forgot all he had thought about his picture before during the three years he had been painting it ; he forgot all its qualities which had been absolutely certain to him - he saw the picture with their indifferent , new , outside eyes , and saw nothing good in it .
Alexey Alexandrovitch was at the ministry .
That &apos;s what will happen .
I don &apos;t say she cared for you , all I meant to say is that her refusal at that moment proves nothing . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know ! &quot; said Levin , jumping up .
But to keep his thoughts free , he had tried to persuade himself that he did not know it .
Wait a little ; I will tell you about myself .
Yes , there was strength in them .
Even Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled .
He wanted to see him , to report on the result of his mediation , which had occupied and amused him for the last three days .
All were sitting like so many priests &quot; wives on a visit ( so the old prince expressed it ) , obviously wondering why they were there , and pumping up remarks simply to avoid being silent .
&quot; Do you admit that education is a benefit for the people ? &quot; &quot; Yes , I admit it , &quot; said Levin without thinking , and he was conscious immediately that he had said what he did not think .
And this misfortune has befallen me .
&quot; No , not now , later ! &quot; he said .
She was frightened of the dog , that ran in after Levin , and uttered a shriek , but began laughing at her own fright at once when she was told the dog would not hurt her .
Varenka seemed quite unaffected by there being persons present she did not know , and she went directly to the piano .
&quot; Of course I know you ; I know you very well , &quot; the prince said to her with a smile , in which Kitty detected with joy that her father liked her friend .
I saw nothing but him , and that the family was broken up .
All his life Alexey Alexandrovitch had lived and worked in official spheres , having to do with the reflection of life .
But this did not trouble the old man .
Still feeling for it , he stretched out to the other side , and not being strong enough to keep his balance , fell over , streaming with blood .
She saw that they felt themselves alone in that crowded room .
Vronsky had that winter got his promotion , was now a colonel , had left the regimental quarters , and was living alone .
&quot; One has but to look at you and one sees , here &apos;s a woman who may be happy or unhappy , but isn &apos;t bored .
She found this comfort through a completely new world being opened to her by means of this acquaintance , a world having nothing in common with her past , an exalted , noble world , from the height of which she could contemplate her past calmly .
And do you know , Kostya , I &apos;ll tell you the truth , &quot; he went on , leaning his elbow on the table , and propping on his hand his handsome ruddy face , in which his moist , good @-@ natured , sleepy eyes shone like stars .
She felt that some unseen force had come to her aid and was supporting her .
Tiny birds twittered , and now and then fluttered from tree to tree .
&quot; I have come to tell you that I am going tomorrow to Moscow , and shall not return again to this house , and you will receive notice of what I decide through the lawyer into whose hands I shall intrust the task of getting a divorce .
That would be dishonest , that would be false , that would be deceiving myself and others .
Joining him , she pressed his hand tightly .
His gentle , soothing words and smiles were as soothing and softening as almond oil .
The wind had been powerful on the steps , but on the platform , under the lee of the carriages , there was a lull .
She took his hand and stroked her chilled cheeks and cropped head with it .
One must struggle to live better , much better .... &quot;
The baby girl - _ his _ child - was so sweet , and had so won Anna &apos;s heart , since she was all that was left her , that Anna rarely thought of her son .
&quot; On the other side , &quot; she said to her husband , &quot; he always sleeps on that side .
And connecting this saying with his forgiveness of her , with his devotion to the children , he understood it now in his own way .
&quot; Besides , I want to turn over a new leaf completely now .
I &apos;m not talking of political economy , I &apos;m talking of the science of agriculture .
The first thing to do to set his heart at rest was to accomplish what he had come to Moscow for .
She went indoors , collected her music , and saying good @-@ bye to everyone , was about to go .
You &apos;re caught , my dear boy . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s my one desire , to be caught , &quot; answered Vronsky , with his serene , good @-@ humored smile .
It was a bright , frosty day .
She knew him , and knew that he would be a good match for her young lady , and was very keen to see the matter settled .
You know , &quot; Levin turned to his brother , &quot; Mihail Semyonovitch is writing a work on the digestive organs of the .... &quot; &quot; Now , make a muddle of it !
He had positively forgotten that picture he had painted three years ago .
She &apos;s just the same as my wife , just the same .
But you &apos;ll make it right , Dolly ?
Even greater was the feeling of disagreement at the bottom of his heart as to her not needing to consider the woman who was with his brother , and he thought with horror of all the contingencies they might meet with .
Come , have a drink .
She felt that the position in the world that she enjoyed , and that had seemed to her of so little consequence in the morning , that this position was precious to her , that she would not have the strength to exchange it for the shameful position of a woman who has abandoned husband and child to join her lover ; that however much she might struggle , she could not be stronger than herself .
The property was a small one .
The prince was anxious to miss nothing of which he would be asked at home , had he seen that in Russia ?
The first time he was able to speak , Varya , his brother &apos;s wife , was alone in the room .
&quot; And how well he &apos;s behaving !
The Vlassieva girl &apos;s quite in love with him . &quot; &quot; And is it true the younger Vlassieva girl &apos;s to marry Topov ? &quot; &quot; Yes , they say it &apos;s quite a settled thing . &quot; &quot; I wonder at the parents !
&quot; I have no right whatever to know family matters , and , to tell the truth , no interest in them either . &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled hardly perceptibly , catching the instantaneous change he knew so well in Levin &apos;s face , which had become as gloomy as it had been bright a minute before .
Only , my savageness is not in having gone away , but in coming now .
You say he won &apos;t forgive me , because you don &apos;t know him .
You have behaved improperly , and I would wish it not to occur again . &quot; She did not hear half of what he was saying ; she felt panic @-@ stricken before him , and was thinking whether it was true that Vronsky was not killed .
&quot; Only you mustn &apos;t be polite and stiff with her .
&quot; It &apos;s a long while since I dreamed it .
But the nearer they got to the springs the oftener they met sick people ; and their appearance seemed more pitiable than ever among the everyday conditions of prosperous German life .
He felt so mirthful that , contrary to his rules , he made a reduction in his terms to the haggling lady , and gave up catching moths , finally deciding that next winter he must have the furniture covered with velvet , like Sigonin &apos;s .
&quot; You &apos;re not angry with me , Stiva ?
Give him your hand . &quot; Vronsky came to the side of the bed , and seeing Anna , again hid his face in his hands .
He read the leading article , in which it was maintained that it was quite senseless in our day to raise an outcry that radicalism was threatening to swallow up all conservative elements , and that the government ought to take measures to crush the revolutionary hydra ; that , on the contrary , &quot; in our opinion the danger lies not in that fantastic revolutionary hydra , but in the obstinacy of traditionalism clogging progress , &quot; etc . , etc .
Good @-@ bye , my darling ! &quot; Chapter 29 &quot; Come , it &apos;s all over , and thank God ! &quot; was the first thought that came to Anna Arkadyevna , when she had said good @-@ bye for the last time to her brother , who had stood blocking up the entrance to the carriage till the third bell rang .
He had noticed often that even in actual praise technique was opposed to essential quality , as though one could paint well something that was bad .
Just as he was passing along the passage , the boy opened the door into the second horse @-@ box on the left , and Vronsky caught a glimpse of a big chestnut horse with white legs .
&quot; Ah , how silly I am today ! &quot; She passed her handkerchief over her face and began dressing .
Spring is the time of plans and projects .
&quot; Base !
The desire for life , waxing stronger with recovered health , was so intense , and the conditions of life were so new and pleasant , that Anna felt unpardonably happy .
There was not a subject he knew nothing of .
Do ride over and see her , please ; help her with advice ; you know all about it .
Some forty had been taken on , and there were no more .
All that seemed so simple to Stepan Arkadyevitch , Alexey Alexandrovitch had thought over thousands of times .
His conception of her was for him a sacred memory , and his future wife was bound to be in his imagination a repetition of that exquisite , holy ideal of a woman that his mother had been .
I tell you . &quot; Chapter 4 &quot; They &apos;ve come ! &quot; &quot; Here he is ! &quot; &quot; Which one ? &quot; &quot; Rather young , eh ? &quot; &quot; Why , my dear soul , she looks more dead than alive ! &quot; were the comments in the crowd , when Levin , meeting his bride in the entrance , walked with her into the church .
The stupid sale of the forest , the fraud practiced upon Oblonsky and concluded in his house , exasperated him .
With what he had in his soul , he felt sore and uncomfortable in the restaurant , in the midst of private rooms where men were dining with ladies , in all this fuss and bustle ; the surroundings of bronzes , looking @-@ glasses , gas , and waiters - all of it was offensive to him .
Levin smiled , bent his arm , and under Stepan Arkadyevitch &apos;s fingers the muscles swelled up like a sound cheese , hard as a knob of iron , through the fine cloth of the coat .
Levin watched all her movements attentively .
I &apos;m not one of those men who submit to uneasiness and worry without having the force of character to face them .
&quot; Very close about money is Konstantin Dmitrievitch , &quot; he said with a smile , turning to Stepan Arkadyevitch ; &quot; there &apos;s positively no dealing with him .
&quot; We Russians are always like that .
His face was ugly and forbidding , as Anna had never seen him .
Her eyes were shining with a soft light .
She flew over it like a bird ; but at the same instant Vronsky , to his horror , felt that he had failed to keep up with the mare &apos;s pace , that he had , he did not know how , made a fearful , unpardonable mistake , in recovering his seat in the saddle .
Both of them , repeating over and over again the same strained movement , were in a perfect frenzy of toil , and were incapable of shifting their position and at the same time watching what was before them .
The morning dew was still lying on the thick undergrowth of the grass , and that he might not get his feet wet , Sergey Ivanovitch asked his brother to drive him in the trap up to the willow tree from which the carp was caught .
&quot; Bring in tea , and tell Seryozha that Alexey Alexandrovitch is here .
&quot; I &apos;ve been thinking about you all this time , and I &apos;m very , very glad you &apos;ve come , &quot; he said , looking him in the face with a significant air .
&quot; Yes , the thing &apos;s done at Mihail Petrovitch &apos;s , but ask him how it &apos;s done .
He stood in the hall , jerking his long thin neck , and pulling the scarf off it , and smiled a strange and pitiful smile .
( Yashvin had bet heavily on Vronsky in the races . )
Golenishtchev recovered himself with an effort , and at first was dejected and gloomy , but Anna , disposed to feel friendly with everyone as she was at that time , soon revived his spirits by her direct and lively manner .
How is she ? &quot; &quot; She is , I believe , quite well , Darya Alexandrovna , &quot; replied Alexey Alexandrovitch , not looking at her .
He recalled with horror his dreams of marrying a peasant girl .
This feeling was now even stronger than before ; even less than before did he feel capable of apprehending the meaning of death , and its inevitability rose up before him more terrible than ever .
&quot; That &apos;s what I &apos;ll do , &quot; he said to himself ; &quot; that &apos;s what I &apos;ll do !
At the time when the racers had to go to the pavilion to receive the prizes , and all attention was directed to that point , Vronsky &apos;s elder brother , Alexander , a colonel with heavy fringed epaulets , came up to him .
Not in that room only , but in the whole world , there existed for him only himself , with enormously increased importance and dignity in his own eyes , and she .
She positively shrank together and flushed to the point of tears , and clutching the ends of her apron in both hands , twisted them in her red fingers without knowing what to say and what to do .
Seeing Alexey Alexandrovitch with his Petersburg face and severely self @-@ confident figure , in his round hat , with his rather prominent spine , he believed in him , and was aware of a disagreeable sensation , such as a man might feel tortured by thirst , who , on reaching a spring , should find a dog , a sheep , or a pig , who has drunk of it and muddied the water .
For the first time in his life he knew the bitterest sort of misfortune , misfortune beyond remedy , and caused by his own fault .
She met Vronsky specially often at Betsy &apos;s for Betsy was a Vronsky by birth and his cousin .
&quot; It &apos;s just as it was at Countess Paul &apos;s , sir .
Never afterwards did he feel it with such intensity , but this first time he could not for a long while get over it .
At eight o &apos;clock in the evening Levin and his wife were drinking tea in their room when Marya Nikolaevna ran in to them breathlessly .
&quot; Ah !
Levin found himself , like the majority of his contemporaries , in the vaguest position in regard to religion .
Come , this is life !
Strange as it may appear , it was with the household , the family , that Konstantin Levin was in love , especially with the feminine half of the household .
He vividly recalled all the constantly recurring instances of inevitable necessity for lying and deceit , which were so against his natural bent .
I put myself entirely in your hands , and trust to your feeling of what &apos;s right . &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch handed back the letter , and with the same surprise continued looking at his brother @-@ in @-@ law , not knowing what to say .
Stepan Arkadyevitch gave a scarcely perceptible smile .
The liberal party said that marriage is an institution quite out of date , and that it needs reconstruction ; and family life certainly afforded Stepan Arkadyevitch little gratification , and forced him into lying and hypocrisy , which was so repulsive to his nature .
The wife did not leave her own room , the husband had not been at home for three days .
He was a little colder to his wife .
&quot; But don &apos;t let us talk any more of it . &quot; Anna &apos;s carriage , which she had sent away , and ordered to come back to the little gate of the Vrede garden , drove up .
On this course nine obstacles had been arranged : the stream , a big and solid barrier five feet high , just before the pavilion , a dry ditch , a ditch full of water , a precipitous slope , an Irish barricade ( one of the most difficult obstacles , consisting of a mound fenced with brushwood , beyond which was a ditch out of sight for the horses , so that the horse had to clear both obstacles or might be killed ) ; then two more ditches filled with water , and one dry one ; and the end of the race was just facing the pavilion .
Formerly he had felt that without this work his life would be too gloomy .
help me , guide me , &quot; said Levin , praying inwardly , and at the same time , feeling a need of violent exercise , he skated about describing inner and outer circles .
&quot; Oh , you may as well sit there , &quot; he said to Levin .
He felt incapable of being either .
He could not help feeling now , since the meaning of this system had become clear to him , that the aim of his energy was a most unworthy one .
Levin gave him his , and angrily waved to his wife to go away .
&quot; Well , see , Kitty , your intense desire to make friends with Mademoiselle .... &quot; &quot; Varenka , &quot; Varenka put in smiling , &quot; that &apos;s what everyone calls me . &quot; Kitty blushed with pleasure , and slowly , without speaking , pressed her new friend &apos;s hand , which did not respond to her pressure , but lay motionless in her hand .
Chapter 21 Before Betsy had time to walk out of the drawing @-@ room , she was met in the doorway by Stepan Arkadyevitch , who had just come from Yeliseev &apos;s , where a consignment of fresh oysters had been received .
Chapter 8 Alexey Alexandrovitch , on coming back from church service , had spent the whole morning indoors .
But a woman must dislike being without a shadow . &quot; &quot; Yes , but women with a shadow usually come to a bad end , &quot; said Anna &apos;s friend .
At that instant the princess came into the drawing @-@ room with the family doctor .
&quot; Well , I am glad I managed to get away to you !
How can she help it if they &apos;re all in love with her , and follow her about like shadows ? &quot; &quot; Oh , I had no idea of blaming her for it , &quot; Anna &apos;s friend said in self @-@ defense .
&quot; Look , &quot; said the colonel , looking out of the window , &quot; what an audience has collected to listen to you . &quot; There actually was quite a considerable crowd under the windows .
The spot of tallow had given the man a new pose .
But the same second he looked round at the young man , and gave the nervous jerk of his head and neck that Konstantin knew so well , as if his neckband hurt him ; and a quite different expression , wild , suffering , and cruel , rested on his emaciated face .
Why not shake hands with him ? &quot; &quot; Because I don &apos;t shake hands with a waiter , and a waiter &apos;s a hundred times better than he is . &quot; &quot; What a reactionist you are , really !
It appeared that two dresses had not been done at all , while the other one had not been altered as Anna had intended .
Vronsky openly flirted with Kitty at balls , danced with her , and came continually to the house , consequently there could be no doubt of the seriousness of his intentions .
But he felt his duties very irksome .
Dressing without hurry ( he never hurried himself , and never lost his self @-@ possession ) , Vronsky drove to the sheds .
&quot; So you won &apos;t recognize your friends !
&quot; Alexey &apos;s playing us false , &quot; she said in French ; &quot; he writes that he can &apos;t come , &quot; she added in a tone as simple and natural as though it could never enter her head that Vronsky could mean anything more to Anna than a game of croquet .
The sketch might be corrected in accordance with the requirements of the figure , the legs , indeed , could and must be put differently , and the position of the left hand must be quite altered ; the hair too might be thrown back .
She recalled with wonder her state of mind on the previous day .
With her indeed he not infrequently fell into discussion upon physics , the theory of agriculture , and especially philosophy ; philosophy was Agafea Mihalovna &apos;s favorite subject .
But here &apos;s for the housekeeping , &quot; he said , taking ten roubles from his pocketbook .
Do you mean he made your _ belle @-@ sœur _ an offer yesterday ? &quot; &quot; Maybe , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch .
To this now was joined the presence , only twenty @-@ five miles off , of Kitty Shtcherbatskaya , whom he longed to see and could not see .
He experienced the sensations of a man who has had a tooth out after suffering long from toothache .
The landowner unmistakably spoke his own individual thought - a thing that very rarely happens - and a thought to which he had been brought not by a desire of finding some exercise for an idle brain , but a thought which had grown up out of the conditions of his life , which he had brooded over in the solitude of his village , and had considered in every aspect .
If he had been asked whether he liked or didn &apos;t like the peasants , Konstantin Levin would have been absolutely at a loss what to reply .
&quot; Unhasting and unresting , &quot; was his motto .
But who was the cause of my doing so ? &quot; &quot; What do you say that to me for ? &quot; she said , glancing severely at him .
&quot; Yes , now it will soon be over , &quot; he thought .
At the very moment when Vronsky thought that now was the time to overtake Mahotin , Frou @-@ Frou herself , understanding his thoughts , without any incitement on his part , gained ground considerably , and began getting alongside of Mahotin on the most favorable side , close to the inner cord .
But in compensation he gave no quarter to the enemy either .
She merely smiled with a pretense of irony when he finished , and made no reply , because she had not heard what he said .
&quot; Mercy !
Oh , yes . &quot; She turned suddenly to Princess Betsy : &quot; I am a nice person ...
Kitty had not simply assured him that she loved him , but had gone so far - in answer to his question , what she loved him for - as to explain what for .
I had it once , but it &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; Excuse me , that &apos;s not true , &quot; said Serpuhovskoy , smiling .
Anna had never met this new star of fashion , and was struck by her beauty , the exaggerated extreme to which her dress was carried , and the boldness of her manners .
Being the youngest , she was her father &apos;s favorite , and she fancied that his love gave him insight .
&quot; All right .
&quot; Why can &apos;t you ?
&quot; I shall be drunk .... Come , tell me how are you getting on ? &quot; he went on , obviously anxious to change the conversation .
Once more he perceived in front of him the same back and short tail , and again the same swiftly moving white legs that got no further away .
And how have you been getting on ? &quot; said Levin , completely forgetting the disagreeable conversation of the previous day .
&quot; What &apos;s the fête ? &quot; &quot; Serpuhovskoy &apos;s come . &quot; &quot; Aha ! &quot; said Vronsky , &quot; why , I didn &apos;t know . &quot; The smile in his eyes gleamed more brightly than ever .
What would you have with those peasants ! &quot; said the bailiff , with a wave of his hand .
He only remembered his face as he remembered all the faces he had ever seen ; but he remembered , too , that it was one of the faces laid by in his memory in the immense class of the falsely consequential and poor in expression .
Instead of poverty , general prosperity and content ; instead of hostility , harmony and unity of interests .
&quot; Why shouldn &apos;t we seek them for ourselves ? &quot; &quot; Because it would be just like inventing afresh the means for constructing railways .
&quot; I think it very noble , &quot; Betsy said about this to the Princess Myakaya .
But enough talking !
&quot; It must be some time , though : it can &apos;t go on like this , &quot; he said , trying to give himself courage .
what fault do you find with her ? &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch frowned , and almost closing his eyes , dropped his head .
&quot; You &apos;re not in pain ? &quot; &quot; A little here . &quot; He pointed to his breast .
Now I must go to him , &quot; she said shortly .
&quot; The electric light everywhere ... a - a - a ! &quot; &quot; Yes , the electric light , &quot; said Levin .
He was so far from conceiving of love for woman apart from marriage that he positively pictured to himself first the family , and only secondarily the woman who would give him a family .
She saw that her daughter was in love with him , but tried to comfort herself with the thought that he was an honorable man , and would not do this .
I told him to come today , he &apos;s to be brought in and to wait for me .... &quot; &quot; Why , do you mean to say you &apos;re selling the forest to Ryabinin ? &quot; &quot; Yes .
When the princess came into the room five minutes later , she found them completely reconciled .
Varenka , in her dark dress , in a black hat with a turn @-@ down brim , was walking up and down the whole length of the arcade with a blind Frenchwoman , and , every time she met Kitty , they exchanged friendly glances .
Frou @-@ Frou was a beast of medium size , not altogether free from reproach , from a breeder &apos;s point of view .
What if she doesn &apos;t see herself what she &apos;s doing ? &quot; he asked himself .
Clover , as he knew , both from books and from his own experience , never did well except when it was sown as early as possible , almost in the snow .
Princess Myakaya could never see why it had that effect , but she knew it had , and took advantage of it .
Half Moscow and Petersburg were friends and relations of Stepan Arkadyevitch .
While her mother was attacking her father , she tried to restrain her mother , so far as filial reverence would allow .
When he came back , Stepan Arkadyevitch , washed and combed , came out of his room with a beaming smile , and they went upstairs together .
&quot; It &apos;s the Petersburg view , madame . &quot; &quot; Not Petersburg , but simply feminine , &quot; she responded .
Those about him felt this , and instinctively did not allow themselves to move freely , to talk , to express their wishes before him .
&quot; I &apos;ve told you what I know , and I repeat that in this delicate and tender matter , as far as one can conjecture , I believe the chances are in your favor . &quot; Levin dropped back in his chair ; his face was pale .
Now , since her return from Moscow , she had come to feel this set insufferable .
A pair of gloves ? &quot; &quot; Done ! &quot; &quot; But it is a pretty sight , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch paused while there was talking about him , but he began again directly .
&quot; Well , I won &apos;t ! &quot; he said .
And stay a little now ; it &apos;s not long I shall .... &quot; But all at once she stopped .
it needs practice ! &quot; Nikolay Shtcherbatsky shouted after him .
The question &apos;s decided ! &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , smiling .
I ought myself to be firmer , to maintain my masculine independence of action ; or else I shall get into such ways , and she &apos;ll get used to them too .... Of course she &apos;s not to blame , &quot; he told himself .
He felt distinctly now how intensely he had longed for her death .
Her last letter , which he had received the day before , had particularly exasperated him by the hints in it that she was quite ready to help him to succeed in the world and in the army , but not to lead a life which was a scandal to all good society .
But as time went on , he saw more and more distinctly that however natural the position now seemed to him , he would not long be allowed to remain in it .
Why not possible ? &quot; &quot; No !
I have quite made up my mind . &quot; &quot; This is awful ! &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch .
_ Fürst _ Shtcherbatsky , _ sammt Gemahlin und Tochter _ , by the apartments they took , and from their name and from the friends they made , were immediately crystallized into a definite place marked out for them .
&quot; What &apos;s that ?
An arbitrator of disputes is no use to me .
There was visiting the watering @-@ place that year a real German Fürstin , in consequence of which the crystallizing process went on more vigorously than ever .
But reflecting that this would be undignified , he turned back again , and clearing his throat , he went up to the bedroom .
That would not only be cruel , and everyone would blame me , but it would be stupid on my part . &quot; &quot; Piotr , call a coach ; I am going to Petersburg , &quot; he said to his servant .
Stepan Arkadyevitch saw immediately that things were not going well in the drawing @-@ room without him .
Eligible suitors , as they call them - I can &apos;t bear to see them .
He did not think of death at all now .
He was standing with his elbows on the back of a chair , and on his face was a look of ironical attention .
Everything went happily at home too ; but at lunch Grisha began whistling , and , what was worse , was disobedient to the English governess , and was forbidden to have any tart .
She had no need to ask why he had come .
&quot; I &apos;ll go away .
Long and broad in the haunch .
He did not know how great a sense of change she was experiencing ; she , who at home had sometimes wanted some favorite dish , or sweets , without the possibility of getting either , now could order what she liked , buy pounds of sweets , spend as much money as she liked , and order any puddings she pleased .
They too looked scared , and stopped at the carriage door to avoid the crowd .
&quot; I will tell him everything , without reserve , and I will make him speak without reserve , too , and I &apos;ll show him that I love him , and so understand him , &quot; Levin resolved to himself , as , towards eleven o &apos;clock , he reached the hotel of which he had the address .
Counted every tree ? &quot; &quot; Of course , they must be counted .
To go over all those fat little legs , pulling on their stockings , to take in her arms and dip those little naked bodies , and to hear their screams of delight and alarm , to see the breathless faces with wide @-@ open , scared , and happy eyes of all her splashing cherubs , was a great pleasure to her .
Darya Alexandrovna had done her hair , and dressed with care and excitement .
She could not talk or think of anything else , and she could not speak to Levin of her misery .
And she could not but appreciate this , even though the very intensity of his solicitude for her , the atmosphere of care with which he surrounded her , sometimes weighed upon her .
&quot; I &apos;ve come to say that there &apos;s still time .
He would again have got his brother @-@ in @-@ law away , but Alexey Alexandrovitch himself inquired , with curiosity : &quot; What did Pryatchnikov fight about ? &quot; &quot; His wife .
God grant only that I may speak as I feel .
&quot; Oh , if it were only some nice person one could talk to a little ! &quot; he thought .
&quot; I &apos;m always amazed at the clearness and precision of your husband &apos;s language , &quot; she said .
&quot; Anyway , I &apos;ll send Parasha . &quot; Kitty saw that Varenka could hardly restrain a smile at the idea that she needed an escort .
However , she was so anxious for the marriage itself , and still more for relief from her fears , that she believed it was so .
All his life was merged in the one feeling of suffering and desire to be rid of it .
&quot; Ah , how nice of you ! &quot; she said , giving her husband her hand , and greeting Sludin , who was like one of the family , with a smile .
You shall see .
Not one conversation with Sviazhsky , though he had said a great deal that was clever , had interested Levin ; but the conclusions of the irascible landowner required consideration .
She stopped , and bending her head back and on one side , began with her rapid hand taking out her hairpins .
&quot; But what is it all about ? &quot; she said , with such genuine and droll wonder .
But her face , to which she tried to give a severe and resolute expression , betrayed bewilderment and suffering .
He was not so much annoyed that he had not received the post , that he had been conspicuously passed over ; but it was incomprehensible , amazing to him that they did not see that the wordy phrase @-@ monger Stremov was the last man fit for it .
to start with ?
And so it is all round .
He simply seemed to be slightly displeased with her for that first midnight conversation , which she had repelled .
&quot; But perhaps the key may yet be found , &quot; thought Alexey Alexandrovitch .
&quot; As for your dislike of it , excuse my saying so , that &apos;s simply our Russian sloth and old serf @-@ owner &apos;s ways , and I &apos;m convinced that in you it &apos;s a temporary error and will pass . &quot; Konstantin was silent .
&quot; Why shouldn &apos;t I go ?
&quot; Thank God ! &quot; she said .
&quot; Come , Sasha , don &apos;t be cross ! &quot; he said , smiling timidly and affectionately at her .
I &apos;ve done silly things , of course , like everyone else , but money &apos;s the last consideration ; I don &apos;t regret it .
In the daytime it thawed in the sun , but at night there were even seven degrees of frost .
&quot; Yes , these kisses - that is what has been bought by this shame .
&quot; The relic of barbarism , the primitive commune with each guarantee for all , will disappear of itself ; serfdom has been abolished - there remains nothing but free labor , and its forms are fixed and ready made , and must be adopted .
You always praise the peasants so . &quot; At that instant another lady came into the room , and Levin got up .
Betsy , dressed in the height of the latest fashion , in a hat that towered somewhere over her head like a shade on a lamp , in a blue dress with violet crossway stripes slanting one way on the bodice and the other way on the skirt , was sitting beside Anna , her tall flat figure held erect .
These were the two leading representatives of the Moscow intellectuals , as Oblonsky had called them .
&quot; Conceited blockhead ! &quot; he thought , as he listened to the celebrated doctor &apos;s chatter about his daughter &apos;s symptoms .
All at once his position had shifted and he knew that something awful had happened .
&quot; Letters may , of course , be a partial confirmation ; but detection in the fact there must be of the most direct kind , that is , by eyewitnesses .
Read it . &quot; She stood still again .
What would be its fruits ?
It was for his interests that every laborer should work as hard as possible , and that while doing so he should keep his wits about him , so as to try not to break the winnowing machines , the horse rakes , the thrashing machines , that he should attend to what he was doing .
&quot; Go , do go ! &quot; she said , looking at him with timid and guilty eyes .
Could that touching pleasure he showed when she came near be the cause of Anna Pavlovna &apos;s coolness ?
&quot; Thank you so much .
She had said it simply from the reflection that as Vronsky would not be here , she had better secure her own freedom , and try to see him somehow .
I sometimes mow myself with the peasants , and tomorrow I want to try mowing the whole day . &quot; Sergey Ivanovitch lifted his head , and looked with interest at his brother .
&quot; I shall come round tomorrow ! &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch shouted to him .
She had not seen him since his abrupt departure from Moscow , and she sent her elder son to bid him come to see her .
In his Petersburg world all people were divided into utterly opposed classes .
You &apos;re busy with the district council , though , aren &apos;t you , and can &apos;t be away for long ? &quot; &quot; No , princess , I &apos;m no longer a member of the council , &quot; he said .
Glancing at his wife and Vronsky , he went up to the lady of the house , and sitting down for a cup of tea , began talking in his deliberate , always audible voice , in his habitual tone of banter , ridiculing someone .
and I &apos;m very sorry I ever came ! &quot; In spite of all Levin &apos;s efforts to soothe his brother afterwards , Nikolay would listen to nothing he said , declaring that it was better to part , and Konstantin saw that it simply was that life was unbearable to him .
I &apos;ve not given up thinking of death , &quot; said Levin .
&quot; Would you like the samovar ? &quot; she asked .
But he always drove away this strange feeling .
Of course , I &apos;ll go , &quot; he decided , lifting his head from the book .
Should not a new cook be sent for ? &quot; &quot; Ah , let me alone , let me alone ! &quot; she said , and going back to her bedroom she sat down in the same place as she had sat when talking to her husband , clasping tightly her thin hands with the rings that slipped down on her bony fingers , and fell to going over in her memory all the conversation .
&quot; That is he .
We must have the benediction and announcement .
&quot; My chief sin is doubt .
She did not know the reason Anna Pavlovna had changed to her , but she guessed it .
And he shut up any of his thoughtless comrades who attempted to allude to his connection .
One of his latest period . &quot; &quot; I tell you what : it &apos;s a lovely day , let &apos;s go and have another look at it , &quot; said Vronsky , addressing Anna .
&quot; Why isn &apos;t the carpenter at the thrashing machine ? &quot; &quot; Oh , I meant to tell you yesterday , the harrows want repairing .
But I know very well why he says it .
Everything went rapidly in her hands , and before it was twelve o &apos;clock all their things were arranged cleanly and tidily in her rooms , in such a way that the hotel rooms seemed like home : the beds were made , brushes , combs , looking @-@ glasses were put out , table napkins were spread .
Anna was unmistakably admiring her loveliness and her youth : before Kitty knew where she was she found herself not merely under Anna &apos;s sway , but in love with her , as young girls do fall in love with older and married women .
&quot; Why take money for posting @-@ horses when everyone knows that there are railways everywhere now ? &quot; But Princess Myakaya did not agree , and the Princess Tverskaya &apos;s opinion annoyed her indeed .
&quot; Of course , &quot; he said to himself , as though a logical , continuous , and clear chain of reasoning had brought him to an indubitable conclusion .
He looked into his sickly , consumptive face , and he was more and more sorry for him , and he could not force himself to listen to what his brother was telling him about the association .
&quot; You understood me , and you understand .
It &apos;s a hopeless case ! &quot; said Katavasov .
&quot; Do you wish to get out ? &quot; asked Annushka .
When I got the telegram , I came here with the same feelings ; I will say more , I longed for her death .
&quot; Turn me over on the other side , &quot; he would say , and immediately after he would ask to be turned back again as before .
And only fancy , &quot; she said in a whisper , &quot; he felt so sorry for her that he stayed and began to help her look after the children .
He had to make an effort to master himself , and to remind himself that people of all sorts were moving about her , and that he too might come there to skate .
He &apos;s cultivated , one sees , simply to be able to despise culture , as they despise everything but animal pleasures . &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you all care for these animal pleasures ? &quot; she said , and again he noticed a dark look in her eyes that avoided him .
&quot; My daughter has lost her heart to you , &quot; she said .
She was scared , shy , shame @-@ faced , and still more charming from it .
She blushed a little , and said : &quot; In the first place it &apos;s never so ; and secondly , if it were , what difference would it make to me ? &quot; &quot; Are you coming to this ball ? &quot; asked Kitty .
The fact that the children had not been at the sacrament for nearly a year worried her extremely , and with the full approval and sympathy of Marya Philimonovna she decided that this should take place now in the summer .
The grass cut with a juicy sound , and was at once laid in high , fragrant rows .
&quot; So you &apos;d better not go .... You understand ; you won &apos;t be offended ? ... &quot; &quot; And it serves me right !
Don &apos;t I know him , the falsity in which he &apos;s utterly steeped ? ...
17,015 and 18,038 , from December 5 , 1863 , and June 7 , 1864 , acted in direct contravention of the intent of the law T ... Act 18 , and the note to Act 36 .
And her black dress , with its sumptuous lace , was not noticeable on her ; it was only the frame , and all that was seen was she - simple , natural , elegant , and at the same time gay and eager .
&quot; When I &apos;m old and ugly I &apos;ll be the same , &quot; Betsy used to say ; &quot; but for a pretty young woman like you it &apos;s early days for that house of charity . &quot; Anna had at first avoided as far as she could Princess Tverskaya &apos;s world , because it necessitated an expenditure beyond her means , and besides in her heart she preferred the first circle .
Alexey Alexandrovitch had thought to pass at once into those frigid relations in which he ought to stand with the brother of a wife against whom he was beginning a suit for divorce .
&quot; Here you are , the forest is mine , &quot; he said , crossing himself quickly , and holding out his hand .
They did not hear the loud remarks and disputes that followed , some maintaining he had stepped on first , and others that both had stepped on together .
First she gathered it together , stuck the fork into it , then with a rapid , supple movement leaned the whole weight of her body on it , and at once with a bend of her back under the red belt she drew herself up , and arching her full bosom under the white smock , with a smart turn swung the fork in her arms , and flung the bundle of hay high onto the cart .
&quot; As you see , &quot; responded Vronsky , knitting his brows , wiping his mouth , and not looking at the officer .
&quot; And do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position ? &quot; Dolly resumed .
Of course , I see how you torture yourself over everything - the world and your son and your husband . &quot; &quot; Oh , not over my husband , &quot; she said , with a quiet smile .
I shall not be alone at dinner again , &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch went on , no longer in a sarcastic tone .
He could say nothing .
Not for anything in the world !
I should like cabbage soup and porridge better than anything ; but of course there &apos;s nothing like that here . &quot; &quot; _ Porridge à la Russe , _ your honor would like ? &quot; said the Tatar , bending down to Levin , like a nurse speaking to a child .
Just see , feel my shirt ; it &apos;s not wet , is it ? &quot; Levin felt , withdrew behind the screen , and put out the candle , but for a long while he could not sleep .
But anything more than that in reality , no one cares to inquire .
It &apos;s so difficult , too , to look well in such a position , not to be ridiculous .
&quot; Mamma !
And he had prepared himself for this ; but he found something utterly different .
&quot; Forgive me for coming , but I couldn &apos;t pass the day without seeing you , &quot; he went on , speaking French , as he always did to avoid using the stiff Russian plural form , so impossibly frigid between them , and the dangerously intimate singular .
Levin gazed admiringly at the cows he knew so intimately to the minutest detail of their condition , and gave orders for them to be driven out into the meadow , and the calves to be let into the paddock .
That evening she saw Vronsky , but she did not tell him of what had passed between her and her husband , though , to make the position definite , it was necessary to tell him .
&quot; Kostya , give orders that if the merchant Ryabinin comes ...
As she took off her outer garment in the hall , she heard the footman , pronouncing his &quot; _ r &apos;s _ &quot; even like a _ Kammerjunker _ , say , &quot; From the count for the princess , &quot; and hand the note .
The old man complained that things were doing badly .
Only it &apos;s no good your talking to her .
Your feelings are an affair of your own conscience ; but I am in duty bound to you , to myself , and to God , to point out to you your duties .
And he was happy at it .
I never supposed it was so interesting !
And therefore , deciding to divide the trousseau into two parts - a larger and smaller trousseau - the princess consented to have the wedding before Lent .
But I have nothing to do with her .
&quot; With laborers . &quot; &quot; The laborers won &apos;t work well , and won &apos;t work with good implements .
Chapter 14 Levin had been married three months .
Some of the peasants went to their coats and put them on ; others - just like Levin himself - merely shrugged their shoulders , enjoying the pleasant coolness of it .
And Philip the gardener , is he living ?
She drew a loud breath and snorted out through her tense nostrils , started , pricked up her sharp ear , and put out her strong , black lip towards Vronsky , as though she would nip hold of his sleeve .
How it is you feel no pity for me , if nothing else , when you know .... &quot; &quot; What do I know ? &quot; &quot; You know I made an offer and that I was refused , &quot; said Levin , and all the tenderness he had been feeling for Kitty a minute before was replaced by a feeling of anger for the slight he had suffered .
He answered her questions , and , seeing that she was agitated , trying to calm her , he began telling her in the simplest tone the details of his preparations for the races .
As he approached her , his beautiful eyes shone with a specially tender light , and with a faint , happy , and modestly triumphant smile ( so it seemed to Levin ) , bowing carefully and respectfully over her , he held out his small broad hand to her .
&quot; That &apos;s it !
Give me some water , quick !
You must rouse yourself , you must look life in the face .
Lily , too , began begging to go to him , and her mother handed her to him ; he sat her on his shoulder and ran along with her .
He cautiously drew away his hand and felt the feet .
But at the bottom of her heart she felt that she was not strong enough to break through anything , that she was not strong enough to get out of her old position , however false and dishonorable it might be .
Oblonsky was evidently upset .
&quot; Come , you &apos;ve done enough trudging about in the heat , &quot; Sergey Ivanovitch would say to him .
The memory of all that had happened after her illness : her reconciliation with her husband , its breakdown , the news of Vronsky &apos;s wound , his visit , the preparations for divorce , the departure from her husband &apos;s house , the parting from her son - all that seemed to her like a delirious dream , from which she had waked up alone with Vronsky abroad .
&quot; Have you known him long ? &quot; asked Kitty .
Young Shtcherbatsky went into the navy , was drowned in the Baltic , and Levin &apos;s relations with the Shtcherbatskys , in spite of his friendship with Oblonsky , became less intimate .
But no matter ; I can &apos;t hide myself , &quot; he thought , and with that manner peculiar to him from childhood , as of a man who has nothing to be ashamed of , Vronsky got out of his sledge and went to the door .
Oh , well , then I can do it in twenty minutes .
&quot; Come , tell me ; this is silly ! &quot; said Vronsky smiling .
They &apos;ve ruined their careers for the sake of women . &quot; &quot; What women ! &quot; said Vronsky , recalling the Frenchwoman and the actress with whom the two men he had mentioned were connected .
Levin loved his brother , but being with him was always a torture .
&quot; Well , well , what was it you were going to say about the prince ?
Besides this , Konstantin Levin was not at his ease with his brother , because in summer in the country Levin was continually busy with work on the land , and the long summer day was not long enough for him to get through all he had to do , while Sergey Ivanovitch was taking a holiday .
Kitty was to be back from abroad in the middle of the summer , and bathing had been prescribed for her .
Anna arrived at Princess Tverskaya &apos;s earlier than the other guests .
The peasants who remained for the night in the meadow scarcely slept all the short summer night .
What is left ? &quot; His mind rapidly ran through his life apart from his love of Anna .
Death , the inevitable end of all , for the first time presented itself to him with irresistible force .
But Sergey Ivanovitch shrugged his shoulders .
The reality of his suffering crushed all hopes in Levin and Kitty and in the sick man himself , leaving no doubt , no memory even of past hopes .
&quot; Yes , more than a year .
But what , what is to be done ? &quot; There was no solution , but that universal solution which life gives to all questions , even the most complex and insoluble .
&quot; I feel quite the opposite ; the better things are , the more natural it seems to me . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ve got a little curl loose , &quot; he said , carefully turning her head round .
Very good .
She did not look out again .
Chapter 11 That which for Vronsky had been almost a whole year the one absorbing desire of his life , replacing all his old desires ; that which for Anna had been an impossible , terrible , and even for that reason more entrancing dream of bliss , that desire had been fulfilled .
The very details , the mere thought of which reduced her husband to terror , immediately engaged her attention .
It was so narrow on Tanya &apos;s shoulders that it was quite painful to look at her .
Some mathematician has said that enjoyment lies in the search for truth , not in the finding it . &quot; Levin listened in silence , and in spite of all the efforts he made , he could not in the least enter into the feelings of his friend and understand his sentiments and the charm of studying such women .
Well , Kitty , have you been skating again ? ... &quot; And she began talking to Kitty .
Chapter 12 Anna and Vronsky had long been exchanging glances , regretting their friend &apos;s flow of cleverness .
I was , and I could not help being in despair .
It was a long way to send to the Shtcherbatskys . &quot;
&quot; The one thing I longed for , the one thing I prayed for , was to cut short this position , so as to devote my life to your happiness . &quot; &quot; Why do you tell me that ? &quot; she said .
No one ever convinces anyone , you know . &quot; &quot; Yes ; that &apos;s true , &quot; said Levin ; &quot; it generally happens that one argues warmly simply because one can &apos;t make out what one &apos;s opponent wants to prove . &quot; Levin had often noticed in discussions between the most intelligent people that after enormous efforts , and an enormous expenditure of logical subtleties and words , the disputants finally arrived at being aware that what they had so long been struggling to prove to one another had long ago , from the beginning of the argument , been known to both , but that they liked different things , and would not define what they liked for fear of its being attacked .
Some of the very peasants who had been most active in wrangling with him over the hay , some whom he had treated with contumely , and who had tried to cheat him , those very peasants had greeted him good @-@ humoredly , and evidently had not , were incapable of having any feeling of rancor against him , any regret , any recollection even of having tried to deceive him .
Anna Arkadyevna , a waltz ? &quot; he said , bending down to her .
Sergey Ivanovitch was only just getting up .
Undressing , she went into the bedroom ; but her face had none of the eagerness which , during her stay in Moscow , had fairly flashed from her eyes and her smile ; on the contrary , now the fire seemed quenched in her , hidden somewhere far away .
Her heart was broken .
At the instant when she was just facing the stairs , he raised his eyes , caught sight of her , and into the expression of his face there passed a shade of embarrassment and dismay .
But when he was all alone in the carriage Alexey Alexandrovitch , to his surprise and delight , felt complete relief both from this pity and from the doubts and agonies of jealousy .
I &apos;ll tell the truth .
Only rarely he suffered from an unsatisfied desire to communicate his stray ideas to someone besides Agafea Mihalovna .
&quot; Tonight , at one o &apos;clock , &quot; she whispered , and , with a heavy sigh , she walked with her light , swift step to meet her son .
&quot; Varenka worships her .
He remembered how his brother , while at the university , and for a year afterwards , had , in spite of the jeers of his companions , lived like a monk , strictly observing all religious rites , services , and fasts , and avoiding every sort of pleasure , especially women .
Liza Merkalova was a thin brunette , with an Oriental , languid type of face , and - as everyone used to say - exquisite enigmatic eyes .
His work , both on the land and on the book , in which the principles of the new land system were to be laid down , had not been abandoned ; but just as formerly these pursuits and ideas had seemed to him petty and trivial in comparison with the darkness that overspread all life , now they seemed as unimportant and petty in comparison with the life that lay before him suffused with the brilliant light of happiness .
Let people say what they like ; anything &apos;s better than misery .... Far better now while there &apos;s still time .... &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand , &quot; she answered , panic @-@ stricken ; &quot; you mean you want to give it up ... don &apos;t want it ? &quot; &quot; Yes , if you don &apos;t love me . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re out of your mind ! &quot; she cried , turning crimson with vexation .
Pestsov had several times during dinner touched upon these questions , but Sergey Ivanovitch and Stepan Arkadyevitch carefully drew him off them .
A footman stood opening the carriage door .
I always disliked him , and so it has turned out . &quot; Levin recalled Kitty &apos;s answer .
One would have thought that nothing could be simpler than for him , a man of good family , rather rich than poor , and thirty @-@ two years old , to make the young Princess Shtcherbatskaya an offer of marriage ; in all likelihood he would at once have been looked upon as a good match .
&quot; What !
The bailiff , a retired quartermaster , whom Stepan Arkadyevitch had taken a fancy to and had appointed bailiff on account of his handsome and respectful appearance as a hall @-@ porter , showed no sympathy for Darya Alexandrovna &apos;s woes .
&quot; But why should I not receive her ?
But their hostess appeared not to observe this , and kept purposely drawing her into the conversation .
On that day of the week and at that time of day people of one set , all acquainted with one another , used to meet on the ice .
But since he did not care either way , he immediately asked Stepan Arkadyevitch , as though it were his duty , to go down to the country and to arrange everything there to the best of his ability with the taste of which he had so much .
No one else in Stepan Arkadyevitch &apos;s place , having to do with such despair , would have ventured to smile ( the smile would have seemed brutal ) ; but in his smile there was so much of sweetness and almost feminine tenderness that his smile did not wound , but softened and soothed .
They sat down to a table covered with an oilcloth cut in slits by penknives .
With the education mamma gave us I was more than innocent , I was stupid .
And it seemed to her that she understood everything , most of all , that he was pleased with her ; and smiling to him , she walked with her rapid step out at the door .
No one knows how to do it ; I must see to it myself , &quot; answered Dolly addressing him .
&quot; But one can &apos;t go on talking in the passage like this ! &quot; Levin said , looking angrily at a gentleman who walked jauntily at that instant across the corridor , as though about his affairs .
He was more lovingly respectful to her than ever , and the constant care that she should not feel the awkwardness of her position never deserted him for a single instant .
Joyfully , intently , and at the same time timidly , he gazed at the approaching figure , and slowly he rose to his feet .
And he did not like it when the process of reasoning brought him into a blind alley .
&quot; I know your and Sergey Ivanovitch &apos;s aristocratic views .
&quot; No , I &apos;ll walk .
The wagons were to begin carting manure earlier , so as to get all done before the early mowing .
But this was so much the better , as going into the dining @-@ room , Stepan Arkadyevitch found to his horror that the port and sherry had been procured from Depré , and not from Levy , and , directing that the coachman should be sent off as speedily as possible to Levy &apos;s , he was going back to the drawing @-@ room .
He was offended , and at once began to say what he had meant to say .
He stopped short , looking at Princess Tverskaya .
&quot; Eh , Matvey ? &quot; he said , shaking his head .
His first steps in the world and in the service had been successful , but two years before he had made a great mistake .
&quot; Everything , everything ! &quot; Kitty assented .
&quot; Ah , &quot; cried Levin joyfully , flinging up both his hands .
But tell me , how do the peasants look at it ?
Several of the riders were in front and several behind , when suddenly Vronsky heard the sound of a horse galloping in the mud behind him , and he was overtaken by Mahotin on his white @-@ legged , lop @-@ eared Gladiator .
&quot; It will come round , it will come round ...
Her dearest friend , her sister , was going away .
For a long while , a very long while it seemed to Levin , the sick man lay motionless .
Stepan Arkadyevitch took in and read a liberal paper , not an extreme one , but one advocating the views held by the majority .
Only then he suddenly awoke to the fact that he had been wrong about the weather and the rain was drenching his hay .
If it &apos;s rational , you &apos;ll be able to keep up the same system with hired labor , &quot; said Sviazhsky .
Among these papers lay the necessary evidence and a rough outline of the speech he intended to make .
Anna had arrived in Petersburg early in the morning ; the carriage had been sent to meet her in accordance with her telegram , and so Alexey Alexandrovitch might have known of her arrival .
I &apos;d even forgotten that it was at all . &quot; Chapter 32 Levin had long before made the observation that when one is uncomfortable with people from their being excessively amenable and meek , one is apt very soon after to find things intolerable from their touchiness and irritability .
At the table , sitting sideways in a low chair , was Vronsky , his face hidden in his hands , weeping .
When he told Kitty of Stepan Arkadyevitch &apos;s advice that they should go abroad , he was much surprised that she did not agree to this , and had some definite requirements of her own in regard to their future .
&quot; Isn &apos;t he ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know why it is , &quot; responded Vronsky , &quot; in all Moscow people - present company of course excepted , &quot; he put in jestingly , &quot; there &apos;s something uncompromising .
He could not have said exactly what it was touched him so .
The servant came back ; everything was shut up - it was Sunday .
He sent out a hay machine for pitching the hay - it was broken at the first row because it was dull work for a peasant to sit on the seat in front with the great wings waving above him .
&quot; There was a consultation yesterday , and the doctor &apos;s here now . &quot; &quot; Take my things , &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch , and feeling some relief at the news that there was still hope of her death , he went into the hall .
The driving snow and the wind rushed to meet her and struggled with her over the door .
With a book under his arm he went upstairs .
And here people purposely let their nails grow as long as they will , and link on small saucers by way of studs , so that they can do nothing with their hands . &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled gaily .
&quot; What a pity she &apos;s lost her looks so , &quot; Countess Nordston said to Madame Lvova .
She held his hand , and did not stir .
Without the slightest hesitation he gave him permission to act as he might judge best .
&quot; But I &apos;m married , and believe me , in getting to know thoroughly one &apos;s wife , if one loves her , as someone has said , one gets to know all women better than if one knew thousands of them . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re coming directly ! &quot; Vronsky shouted to an officer , who looked into the room and called them to the colonel .
I haven &apos;t conquered anyone ; and I &apos;m obliged to take off my own boots , yes , and put them away too ; in the morning , get up and dress at once , and go to the dining @-@ room to drink bad tea !
Her face was brilliant and glowing ; but this glow was not one of brightness ; it suggested the fearful glow of a conflagration in the midst of a dark night .
But there is another woman in me , I &apos;m afraid of her : she loved that man , and I tried to hate you , and could not forget about her that used to be .
&quot; Oh , this is awful , awful !
How ?
&quot; Don &apos;t you think I want more thinning down ? &quot; &quot; Oh , no , &quot; answered the Englishman .
This is stifling her . &quot; &quot; Yes , yes ... just so .... &quot; Oblonsky said , sighing .
&quot; He has no time free ; he is always busy .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if you remember me , but I must recall myself to thank you for your kindness to my daughter , &quot; he said , taking off his hat and not putting it on again .
The celebrated physician , a very handsome man , still youngish , asked to examine the patient .
He dropped his legs , crossed one leg over the other knee , and taking it in his hand , felt the springy muscle of the calf , where it had been grazed the day before by his fall , and leaning back he drew several deep breaths .
These were idle considerations - beside the point .
He had stood through the litany , the evening service and the midnight service , and the next day he got up earlier than usual , and without having tea went at eight o &apos;clock in the morning to the church for the morning service and the confession .
An ugly , good @-@ natured man , as he considered himself , might , he supposed , be liked as a friend ; but to be loved with such a love as that with which he loved Kitty , one would need to be a handsome and , still more , a distinguished man .
&quot; You see , I &apos;ve come to you , &quot; said Nikolay in a thick voice , never for one second taking his eyes off his brother &apos;s face .
&quot; Will you be at the races ? &quot; he added , as he sank into his seat in the carriage .
I &apos;ll tell you what I should like - should like so much ! &quot; she wrote the initial letters , _ i , y , c , f , a , f , w , h . _ This meant , &quot; If you could forget and forgive what happened . &quot; He snatched the chalk with nervous , trembling fingers , and breaking it , wrote the initial letters of the following phrase , &quot; I have nothing to forget and to forgive ; I have never ceased to love you . &quot; She glanced at him with a smile that did not waver .
&quot; In general terms , he &apos;ll say in his official manner , and with all distinctness and precision , that he cannot let me go , but will take all measures in his power to prevent scandal .
Taking the note from him , she read it .
&quot; I &apos;ve been meaning to a long while , but I &apos;ve been unwell all the time .
He felt himself on a pinnacle that made him giddy , and far away down below were all those nice excellent Karenins , Oblonskys , and all the world .
I assure you Talleyrand couldn &apos;t hold a candle to me . &quot; &quot; Why , where was the difficulty ? &quot; &quot; Ah , you shall hear .... We apologize in due form : we are in despair , we entreat forgiveness for the unfortunate misunderstanding .
And as a fact , in such cases the emotional disturbance set up in Alexey Alexandrovitch by the sight of tears found expression in hasty anger .
I didn &apos;t mean to say this to you , but you &apos;ve made me .
It seemed as though she were not only well and blooming , but in the happiest frame of mind .
&quot; You are acquainted ? &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch asked in surprise .
This support was her son .
Alexey Alexandrovitch had not had time to read the pamphlet through in the evening , and finished it in the morning .
So bright , so cheerful ! &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , forgetting that it was not always spring and fine weather like that day .
He felt that love saved him from despair , and that this love , under the menace of despair , had become still stronger and purer .
Divorce appeared to him impossible also on other still more weighty grounds .
&quot; You behaved wrongly , very wrongly . &quot; &quot; Do you suppose I don &apos;t know that I &apos;ve acted wrongly ?
They all stared at him , but no one made any remark , till a tall old man , with a wrinkled , beardless face , wearing a short sheepskin jacket , came out into the road and accosted him .
Looking at him , she had a physical sense of her humiliation , and she could say nothing more .
Levin sat down by them ; he felt disinclined to go away .
I remember the time when he came to me and cried , talking of you , and all the poetry and loftiness of his feeling for you , and I know that the longer he has lived with you the loftier you have been in his eyes .
This life was disclosed in religion , but a religion having nothing in common with that one which Kitty had known from childhood , and which found expression in litanies and all @-@ night services at the Widow &apos;s Home , where one might meet one &apos;s friends , and in learning by heart Slavonic texts with the priest .
&quot; Once more , &quot; he said to himself , smiling unconsciously , &quot; once more I shall see her walk , her face ; she will say something , turn her head , glance , smile , maybe . &quot; But before he caught sight of her , he saw her husband , whom the station @-@ master was deferentially escorting through the crowd .
She will not forgive me , &quot; he thought .
&quot; I &apos;d positively forgotten her even . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s much better . &quot; &quot; Well , anyway I &apos;ll run down to her .
To the astonishment of the commission , he announced that he should ask permission to go himself to investigate the question on the spot .
The conversation , at times general and at times between individuals , never paused , and towards the end the company was so lively that the men rose from the table , without stopping speaking , and even Alexey Alexandrovitch thawed .
Now I speak only of your external attitude .
&quot; Oh , these invalid ladies ! &quot; &quot; Oh , no , papa ! &quot; Kitty objected warmly .
That &apos;s a fact by now , as you &apos;re probably aware . &quot; &quot; I have some idea of it , but very vague . &quot; &quot; No , you only say that ; no doubt you know all about it as well as I do .
The smile was faint , scarcely perceptible , and in spite of the smile the stern expression of the eyes was unchanged .
How exquisite this steely water is ! &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch .
It appears that it &apos;s a happy couple , a government clerk and his lady .
It was nearly forty miles from Levin &apos;s Pokrovskoe .
But here &apos;s the train . &quot; The engine had already whistled in the distance .
All the long way to his brother &apos;s , Levin vividly recalled all the facts familiar to him of his brother Nikolay &apos;s life .
The dinner was a very merry one : Sergey Ivanovitch was in his happiest mood , and was much amused by Katavasov &apos;s originality .
Do you know him ? &quot; &quot; To be sure I do .
&quot; Yes ; I had no idea it would be so thrilling , &quot; said Anna , blushing .
&quot; Bravo , Vronsky ! &quot; he heard shouts from a knot of men - he knew they were his friends in the regiment - who were standing at the obstacle .
&quot; The horse is here belonging to Mak ... Mak ...
shameful , unpardonable !
She is bound to be unhappy , but I am not to blame , and so I cannot be unhappy . &quot; Chapter 14 As he neared Petersburg , Alexey Alexandrovitch not only adhered entirely to his decision , but was even composing in his head the letter he would write to his wife .
She knew Levin had work he loved in the country .
I must ask for a little concession . &quot; &quot; But is the thing settled between you or not ?
At the corner of the pavement , in a short , stylish overcoat and a low @-@ crowned fashionable hat , jauntily askew , with a smile that showed a gleam of white teeth and red lips , stood Stepan Arkadyevitch , radiant , young , and beaming .
But on the way , as she passed the drawing @-@ room , she beheld a scene , filling her heart with such pleasure that the tears came into her eyes , and she forgave the delinquent herself .
But all that was at first .
His eyes had still the same intense , reproachful look .
&quot; Well , and for some reason Anna Pavlovna told him that he didn &apos;t want to go because you are here .
To remain under such undeserved reproach was wretched , but to make her suffer by justifying himself was worse still .
&quot; What does it mean ?
Kitty and Varenka went out into the little garden that adjoined the house .
These letters meant , &quot; When you told me it could never be , did that mean never , or then ? &quot; There seemed no likelihood that she could make out this complicated sentence ; but he looked at her as though his life depended on her understanding the words .
His brother dressed with particular care - a thing he never used to do - combed his scanty , lank hair , and , smiling , went upstairs .
&quot; Well , I &apos;ll spend a month or two with you , and then I &apos;m off to Moscow .
Everyone was good @-@ humored , but Kitty could not feel good @-@ humored , and this increased her distress .
&quot; Now , when shall we see each other again ?
And that &apos;s how it is the whole level of husbandry has fallen .
&quot; What precisely has she done ? &quot; &quot; She has forsaken her duty , and deceived her husband .
shall I be left alone - without her ? &quot; he thought with horror , and he took the chalk .
I &apos;ll make it all right . &quot; And having made peace with his wife he put on an olive @-@ green overcoat with a velvet collar and a hat , and went towards his studio .
&quot; I asked the doctor ; he said he couldn &apos;t live more than three days .
&quot; Even when this little feather @-@ head fancied .... &quot; &quot; Papa ! &quot; shrieked Kitty , and shut his mouth with her hands .
If you knew how terrible it is to me , what I would give to be able to love you freely and boldly !
I expected even more . &quot; Serpuhovskoy smiled .
Thick @-@ set and of middle height , with nimble movements , with his brown hat , olive @-@ green coat and narrow trousers - though wide trousers had been a long while in fashion , - most of all , with the ordinariness of his broad face , and the combined expression of timidity and anxiety to keep up his dignity , Mihailov made an unpleasant impression .
&quot; There &apos;s no doubt our society is still so barbarous ( it &apos;s not the same in England ) that very many &quot; - and among these were those whose opinion Alexey Alexandrovitch particularly valued - &quot; look favorably on the duel ; but what result is attained by it ?
&quot; The dog now ... why , she understands that her master &apos;s come home , and that he &apos;s low @-@ spirited . &quot; &quot; Why low @-@ spirited ? &quot; &quot; Do you suppose I don &apos;t see it , sir ?
We are just talking things over like gentlemen .
Vronsky could not answer questions , could not speak to anyone .
The horses harnessed to the ploughs and harrows were sleek and fat .
&quot; You were not mistaken .
In the dining @-@ room he rang the bell , and told the servant who came in to send again for the doctor .
Only I must go round to the counting house and see to things . &quot; He got up , stretching and smiling .
It was strange how Mihailov could have discovered just her characteristic beauty .
it &apos;s a long while since I &apos;ve laughed so much ! &quot; said Varenka , gathering up her parasol and her bag .
One longed to throw off that yoke that crushed us , all decent people among us .
At three o &apos;clock she too went away , promising to come to dinner .
&quot; I think of the children , and for that reason I would do anything in the world to save them , but I don &apos;t myself know how to save them .
Come , tell us how does your land do - does it pay ? &quot; said Levin , and at once in Sviazhsky &apos;s eyes he detected that fleeting expression of alarm which he had noticed whenever he had tried to penetrate beyond the outer chambers of Sviazhsky &apos;s mind .
His brother had been the person nearest to his heart , but he had a post in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , and was always abroad , where he had died shortly after Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s marriage .
&quot; Are they up ? &quot; &quot; Pray walk in !
The marsh was dry and there were no grouse at all .
In the villages , I think , there is plenty of work as it is .
How is my darling Anna ?
She &apos;s not to blame in any way .
But he had never connected these scientific deductions as to the origin of man as an animal , as to reflex action , biology , and sociology , with those questions as to the meaning of life and death to himself , which had of late been more and more often in his mind .
There she met Vronsky , and experienced an agitating joy at those meetings .
They were ploughing your field .
&quot; That you may know that since you have not carried out my wishes in regard to observing outward decorum , I will take measures to put an end to this state of things . &quot; &quot; Soon , very soon , it will end , anyway , &quot; she said ; and again , at the thought of death near at hand and now desired , tears came into her eyes .
Sergey Ivanovitch listened attentively , asked him questions , and , roused by a new listener , he talked fluently , uttered a few keen and weighty observations , respectfully appreciated by the young doctor , and was soon in that eager frame of mind his brother knew so well , which always , with him , followed a brilliant and eager conversation .
&quot; By all means , and good @-@ night ! &quot; And signing each other with the cross , the husband and wife parted with a kiss , feeling that they each remained of their own opinion .
The sound of the footman &apos;s steps forced her to rouse herself , and , hiding her face from him , she pretended to be writing .
Parmenitch , a talkative , comely old man , gave Levin a very warm welcome , showed him all he was doing , told him everything about his bees and the swarms of that year ; but gave vague and unwilling answers to Levin &apos;s inquiries about the mowing .
I imagine our relations must change . &quot; &quot; Why so ?
Chapter 11 On entering the studio , Mihailov once more scanned his visitors and noted down in his imagination Vronsky &apos;s expression too , and especially his jaws .
Anna liked her , but today she seemed to be seeing her for the first time with all her defects .
&quot; Kouzma , bring it down , please .
They moved a hundred paces .
You drive along there , and I &apos;ll come and fetch you , and we &apos;ll go and dine somewhere together . &quot; &quot; Capital .
The crop of clover coming up in the stubble was magnificent .
Come along , I &apos;ll introduce you to Karenin . &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch , for all his liberal views , was well aware that to meet Karenin was sure to be felt a flattering distinction , and so treated his best friends to this honor .
&quot; I &apos;m awfully fond of it .
&quot; It &apos;s not time yet ; I think I &apos;m too early , &quot; he said glancing round the empty drawing @-@ room .
&quot; I see that my presence is irksome to you .
There &apos;s nothing I &apos;m so thankful to the revival of the old fashions for as the kissing the hand . &quot; He kissed Betsy &apos;s hand .
&quot; Well , why have you come to Moscow , then ? ...
&quot; What can I decide upon alone ?
He longed to look round again , but he did not dare do this , and tried to be cool and not to urge on his mare so to keep the same reserve of force in her as he felt that Gladiator still kept .
&quot; What do you say to my home @-@ brew , eh ?
I may be inferior to them , stupider perhaps , though I don &apos;t see why I should be inferior to them .
&quot; Anna Arkadyevna , &quot; the countess said in explanation to her son , &quot; has a little son eight years old , I believe , and she has never been parted from him before , and she keeps fretting over leaving him . &quot; &quot; Yes , the countess and I have been talking all the time , I of my son and she of hers , &quot; said Madame Karenina , and again a smile lighted up her face , a caressing smile intended for him .
Here , take it , &quot; she said to Tanya , who was pulling the loosely @-@ fitting ring off her white , slender @-@ tipped finger .
&quot; Yes ; is that music at his place ? &quot; he said , listening to the familiar sounds of polkas and waltzes floating across to him .
&quot; But you &apos;ve rather a feverish @-@ looking color , &quot; he said , laying stress on the word &quot; feverish . &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve been talking too much , &quot; said Betsy .
Raising himself , Levin began considering how much had been cut and how much more could still be done that day .
&quot; Oh , nonsense , Dolly , always making difficulties , &quot; answered her husband .
And there are indications ; malnutrition , nervous excitability , and so on .
Horror and excitement were suddenly replaced by a look of soft , solemn , blissful attention .
He must have left his wife &apos;s room by the other door .
When the report was over , Alexey Alexandrovitch announced in his subdued , delicate voice that he had several points to bring before the meeting in regard to the Commission for the Reorganization of the Native Tribes .
It &apos;s an old trick .
He saw the smile , and a strange misapprehension came over him .
Again I call out all my diplomacy , and again as soon as the thing was about at an end , our friend the government clerk gets hot and red , and his sausages stand on end with wrath , and once more I launch out into diplomatic wiles . &quot; &quot; Ah , he must tell you this story ! &quot; said Betsy , laughing , to a lady who came into her box .
&quot; Well , of course !
That was one disagreeable thing .
It meant , &quot; Then I could not answer differently . &quot; He glanced at her questioningly , timidly .
They even rigged up a bathing @-@ shed of straw hurdles .
Stepan Arkadyevitch could be calm when he thought of his wife , he could hope that she would _ come round _ , as Matvey expressed it , and could quietly go on reading his paper and drinking his coffee ; but when he saw her tortured , suffering face , heard the tone of her voice , submissive to fate and full of despair , there was a catch in his breath and a lump in his throat , and his eyes began to shine with tears .
&quot; But why not ?
And it was as natural for him to talk well and cleverly , as it is natural for a child to skip about .
At last , as it were regretfully tearing himself away , he dropped the cloth , and , exhausted but happy , went home .
&quot; Thank God , she has refused him , &quot; thought the mother , and her face lighted up with the habitual smile with which she greeted her guests on Thursdays .
He wouldn &apos;t look at a bargain that gave him ten , fifteen per cent profit , but holds back to buy a rouble &apos;s worth for twenty kopecks . &quot; &quot; Well , enough of it !
He had planted a great many potatoes , and his potatoes , as Levin had seen driving past , were already past flowering and beginning to die down , while Levin &apos;s were only just coming into flower .
By taking them away from their father , or by leaving them with a vicious father - yes , a vicious father .... Tell me , after what ... has happened , can we live together ?
The pose chosen by Vronsky with their removal into the palazzo was completely successful , and having , through Golenishtchev , made acquaintance with a few interesting people , for a time he was satisfied .
Alexey Alexandrovitch , with a following of those who saw the danger of so revolutionary an attitude to official documents , persisted in upholding the statements obtained by the revising commission .
Vronsky was continually conscious of the necessity of never for a second relaxing the tone of stern official respectfulness , that he might not himself be insulted .
Oh , very well then , give her to a nurse .
On seeing her , he would have risen , but changed his mind , then his face flushed hotly - a thing Anna had never seen before , and he got up quickly and went to meet her , looking not at her eyes , but above them at her forehead and hair .
Kitty sent for the priest to read the prayer for the dying .
The center of this circle was the Countess Lidia Ivanovna .
&quot; Is there anyone we have not met ?
Although Levin believed himself to have the most exact conceptions of domestic life , unconsciously , like all men , he pictured domestic life as the happiest enjoyment of love , with nothing to hinder and no petty cares to distract .
If he had indeed on previous occasions struck and impressed people who did not know him by his air of unhesitating composure , he seemed now more haughty and self @-@ possessed than ever .
He knew that however much they tried , they could not hire more than forty - thirty @-@ seven perhaps or thirty @-@ eight - laborers for a reasonable sum .
&quot; There &apos;s some gentleman , Nikolay Dmitrievitch , &quot; she said .
Which of them will nationalize the other ?
The colonel returned to the table , went out again onto the steps with a tumbler in his hand , and proposed the toast , &quot; To the health of our former comrade , the gallant general , Prince Serpuhovskoy .
Most difficult of all in this position was the fact that he could not in any way connect and reconcile his past with what was now .
An owl hooted not far off , and Laska , starting , stepped cautiously a few steps forward , and putting her head on one side , began to listen intently .
How explain it without the Creator ? &quot; he said , looking inquiringly at Levin .
&quot; I must repeat that . &quot; &quot; Matvey ! &quot; he shouted .
Darya Alexandrovna too , as she said good @-@ bye to him , gave him a sort of congratulation , saying , &quot; How glad I am you have met Kitty again !
Now he was delighted and excited at the visit of these people of consequence , Russians , who had come in their carriage .
Madame Sviazhskaya was a round @-@ faced , fair @-@ haired , rather short woman , all smiles and dimples .
I can &apos;t say yet that all is over ; on the contrary , I feel that it &apos;s not over .
They made peace .
One of the members going down - a lean official with a portfolio - stood out of his way and looked disapprovingly at the legs of the stranger , then glanced inquiringly at Oblonsky .
&quot; What sort of doubt can there be of the existence of God ? &quot; he said hurriedly , with a just perceptible smile .
But in the world , he &apos;s the most amiable man I know , and a devoted croquet player .
The abundant hair and very open forehead gave an appearance of consequence to the face , which had only one expression - a petty , childish , peevish expression , concentrated just above the bridge of the narrow nose .
This was really too tragic , and Darya Alexandrovna made up her mind to persuade the English governess to forgive Grisha , and she went to speak to her .
&quot; Let us go to mamma ! &quot; she said , taking him by the hand .
&quot; It would have been miserable for you to be alone , &quot; she said , and lifting her hands which hid her cheeks flushing with pleasure , twisted her coil of hair on the nape of her neck and pinned it there .
&quot; But I am alive still .
Levin longed to say something to her , but he did not know whether it was all over .
The grouse @-@ marsh , in the Surovsky district , had long tempted Levin , but he had continually put off this visit on account of his work on the estate .
&quot; Well , there &apos;s really nothing of any consequence ; only that Mihail Alexeyevitch &quot; ( that was the artist &apos;s name ) &quot; had meant to leave earlier , and now he doesn &apos;t want to go away , &quot; said Varenka , smiling .
But the sick man , though he seemed and was indifferent about it , was not angry , but only abashed , and on the whole as it were interested in what she was doing with him .
&quot; You &apos;ve simply borrowed an idea that &apos;s not your own , but you &apos;ve distorted it , and are trying to apply it where it &apos;s not applicable . &quot; &quot; But I tell you it &apos;s nothing to do with it .
And clutching at the cold door post , she clambered up the steps and got rapidly into the corridor of the carriage .
Then he sent for the Englishman and the money @-@ lender , and divided what money he had according to the accounts he intended to pay .
&quot; Anything is possible , &quot; she added with that peculiar , rather sly expression that was always in her face when she spoke of religion .
Cord quickened his step , following him .
&quot; You have killed a bear , I &apos;ve been told ! &quot; said Kitty , trying assiduously to catch with her fork a perverse mushroom that would slip away , and setting the lace quivering over her white arm .
A nobody , not wanted by anyone , nor of use to anybody . &quot; And he recalled his brother Nikolay , and dwelt with pleasure on the thought of him .
&quot; Give me some broth .
Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled coldly , with his lips alone , meaning to signify to her and to himself the firmness of his conviction ; but this warm defense , though it could not shake him , reopened his wound .
&quot; You don &apos;t mind ? - it &apos;s so stifling .
&quot; One word more : in any case I advise you to settle the question soon .
But for that there &apos;d be nothing for it but to give it all up and run away . &quot; Obviously the landowner was chaffing Sviazhsky , who , far from resenting it , was apparently amused by it .
But in this case one wants first to be convinced that one has certain qualifications for this sort of business , and especially that all this business is of great importance . &quot; &quot; What !
One of the clerks , without getting up , turned wrathfully to Alexey Alexandrovitch , half closing his eyes .
Taking up his manuscript , reading through what he had written , he found with pleasure that the work was worth his working at .
&quot; She is coming to me , &quot; thought Vronsky , &quot; and better she should .
That &apos;s always at the end . &quot; The deacon &apos;s hand in a plush cuff accepted a three @-@ rouble note unobtrusively , and the deacon said he would put it down in the register , and his new boots creaking jauntily over the flagstones of the empty church , he went to the altar .
In the first letter , Marya Nikolaevna wrote that his brother had sent her away for no fault of hers , and , with touching simplicity , added that though she was in want again , she asked for nothing , and wished for nothing , but was only tormented by the thought that Nikolay Dmitrievitch would come to grief without her , owing to the weak state of his health , and begged his brother to look after him .
&quot; Wait a minute , you don &apos;t know ... stay a little , stay ! ... &quot; She stopped , as though collecting her ideas .
If you like , I &apos;ll make acquaintance with Madame Stahl ; I used to know her _ belle @-@ sœur _ , &quot; added the princess , lifting her head haughtily .
To Levin , as to any unbeliever who respects the beliefs of others , it was exceedingly disagreeable to be present at and take part in church ceremonies .
&quot; No , you do as I told you , &quot; he said , softening his words with a smile , and with a brief explanation of his view of the matter he turned away from the papers , and said : &quot; So do it that way , if you please , Zahar Nikititch . &quot; The secretary retired in confusion .
&quot; I &apos;m coming , too , but I have to go to the Countess Bonina &apos;s rehearsal .
And it vaguely came into Levin &apos;s mind that she herself was not to blame ( she could not be to blame for anything ) , but what was to blame was her education , too superficial and frivolous .
Just as he liked and praised a country life in comparison with the life he did not like , so too he liked the peasantry in contradistinction to the class of men he did not like , and so too he knew the peasantry as something distinct from and opposed to men generally .
Isn &apos;t it true there &apos;s something good and sweet in her ? &quot; &quot; Were you never before in Moscow ? &quot; Konstantin said to her , for the sake of saying something .
&quot; Get along with you , my dear ! &quot; Levin , guilty and shamefaced , but pacified , went back to his hotel .
What is it gives her the power to look down on everything , to be calm independently of everything ?
What a piteous face ! &quot; he asked , noticing a sick man of medium height sitting on a bench , wearing a brown overcoat and white trousers that fell in strange folds about his long , fleshless legs .
But if the man were to come with the doll and sit before a man in love , and begin caressing his doll as the lover caressed the woman he loved , it would be distasteful to the lover .
After obtaining his brother &apos;s address from Sergey Ivanovitch &apos;s footman , Levin was on the point of setting off at once to see him , but on second thought he decided to put off his visit till the evening .
Now , a few days ago , everything was suddenly spoiled .
Moments of doubt were continually coming upon her , when she was uncertain whether the train were going forwards or backwards , or were standing still altogether ; whether it were Annushka at her side or a stranger .
They were just going in at the door , talking of the weather , when Stepan Arkadyevitch overtook them .
But still it &apos;s queer to me , just as at this moment it seems queer to me that we country folks try to get our meals over as soon as we can , so as to be ready for our work , while here are we trying to drag out our meal as long as possible , and with that object eating oysters .... &quot; &quot; Why , of course , &quot; objected Stepan Arkadyevitch .
And he was glad he had told her it , that she knew it now and was thinking of it .
He walked rapidly to the door of his studio , and in spite of his excitement he was struck by the soft light on Anna &apos;s figure as she stood in the shade of the entrance listening to Golenishtchev , who was eagerly telling her something , while she evidently wanted to look round at the artist .
Oh , no , better the classic Chablis . &quot; &quot; Yes , sir .
And now what does he do ?
&quot; Oh , yes , I deserve a great deal , for I &apos;ve become a most serious person .
&quot; I didn &apos;t mean , it wasn &apos;t weakness , it wasn &apos;t ...
He felt that if they had both not kept up appearances , but had spoken , as it is called , from the heart - that is to say , had said only just what they were thinking and feeling - they would simply have looked into each other &apos;s faces , and Konstantin could only have said , &quot; You &apos;re dying , you &apos;re dying ! &quot; and Nikolay could only have answered , &quot; I know I &apos;m dying , but I &apos;m afraid , I &apos;m afraid , I &apos;m afraid ! &quot; And they could have said nothing more , if they had said only what was in their hearts .
He felt almost like a man not dressed in a crowd .
&quot; But can the trousseau and the benediction and all that - can it spoil my happiness ?
Now Alexey Alexandrovitch intended to demand : First , that a new commission should be formed which should be empowered to investigate the condition of the native tribes on the spot ; secondly , if it should appear that the condition of the native tribes actually was such as it appeared to be from the official documents in the hands of the committee , that another new scientific commission should be appointed to investigate the deplorable condition of the native tribes from the - ( 1 ) political , ( 2 ) administrative , ( 3 ) economic , ( 4 ) ethnographical , ( 5 ) material , and ( 6 ) religious points of view ; thirdly , that evidence should be required from the rival department of the measures that had been taken during the last ten years by that department for averting the disastrous conditions in which the native tribes were now placed ; and fourthly and finally , that that department explain why it had , as appeared from the evidence before the committee , from No .
The divorced mother would have her own illegitimate family , in which his position as a stepson and his education would not be good .
Chapter 27 The house was big and old @-@ fashioned , and Levin , though he lived alone , had the whole house heated and used .
Anna gazed at him and did not know what to say .
And he went off to get skates .
He was standing still , not taking off his coat , pulling something out of his pocket .
At this moment , in his present softened state of feeling , sensitive to everything , this inevitable act of hypocrisy was not merely painful to Levin , it seemed to him utterly impossible .
&quot; Only then ? &quot; &quot; Yes , &quot; her smile answered .
&quot; It was not in the least painful to me .
Anna was not in lilac , as Kitty had so urgently wished , but in a black , low @-@ cut , velvet gown , showing her full throat and shoulders , that looked as though carved in old ivory , and her rounded arms , with tiny , slender wrists .
There was nothing remarkable in all this conversation , but never after could Anna recall this brief scene without an agonizing pang of shame .
I &apos;m made that way .
As for the amusements of bachelor existence , which had provided Vronsky with entertainment on previous tours abroad , they could not be thought of , since the sole attempt of the sort had led to a sudden attack of depression in Anna , quite out of proportion with the cause - a late supper with bachelor friends .
In spite of his assertion to the contrary , she was firmly persuaded that he was as much a Christian as she , and indeed a far better one ; and all that he said about it was simply one of his absurd masculine freaks , just as he would say about her _ broderie anglaise _ that good people patch holes , but that she cut them on purpose , and so on .
He stroked her , and she promptly curled up at his feet , laying her head on a hindpaw .
can I believe him ?
&quot; I must be going home , &quot; said Varenka , getting up , and again she went off into a giggle .
Yes , vile , base creature !
She sat down on her lounge beside Annushka , and looked about her in the twilight of the sleeping @-@ carriage .
For several days before , Darya Alexandrovna was busily deliberating on how to dress all the children .
There happened to him at that instant what does happen to people when they are unexpectedly caught in something very disgraceful .
&quot; Please , don &apos;t speak loud .
&quot; Because the forest is worth at least a hundred and fifty roubles the acre , &quot; answered Levin .
But the door had opened more than ten times , and each time it was either a belated guest or guests , who joined the circle of the invited on the right , or a spectator , who had eluded or softened the police officer , and went to join the crowd of outsiders on the left .
&quot; Yes .
I felt sorry for him , but after talking to you , I see it , as a woman , quite differently .
Meanwhile Dolly and the children had moved into the country , to cut down expenses as much as possible .
But if I have , I &apos;ll catch them .
And here he comes . &quot; The unexpected young visitor , whom Sappho had invited , and whom she had forgotten , was , however , a personage of such consequence that , in spite of his youth , both the ladies rose on his entrance .
I love _ her _ . &quot; Chapter 13 None but those who were most intimate with Alexey Alexandrovitch knew that , while on the surface the coldest and most reasonable of men , he had one weakness quite opposed to the general trend of his character .
And they bring forward some notion , some policy that they don &apos;t believe in , that does harm ; and the whole policy is really only a means to a government house and so much income .
The price is magnificent ; thirty @-@ eight thousand .
She had said : &quot; _ No , that cannot be _ .... &quot; &quot; Darya Alexandrovna , &quot; he said dryly , &quot; I appreciate your confidence in me ; I believe you are making a mistake .
And in what way a knowledge of addition and subtraction and the catechism is going to improve their material condition , I never could make out .
This had jarred upon him then , and now her trivial cares and anxieties jarred upon him several times .
When he spoke to her in Russian , using the Russian &quot; thou &quot; of intimacy and affection , it was insufferably irritating to Anna .
They prayed : &quot; Endow them with continence and fruitfulness , and vouchsafe that their hearts may rejoice looking upon their sons and daughters . &quot; They alluded to God &apos;s creation of a wife from Adam &apos;s rib &quot; and for this cause a man shall leave father and mother , and cleave unto his wife , and they two shall be one flesh , &quot; and that &quot; this is a great mystery &quot; ; they prayed that God would make them fruitful and bless them , like Isaac and Rebecca , Joseph , Moses and Zipporah , and that they might look upon their children &apos;s children .
&quot; I imagine such signs are generally very well known , &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch .
&quot; Possibly I was mistaken , &quot; said he .
But on this occasion she entirely misinterpreted what he had said .
She hoped that this interview would transform her position , and save her .
She noticed , too , that when she had found a Catholic priest with her , Madame Stahl had studiously kept her face in the shadow of the lamp @-@ shade and had smiled in a peculiar way .
&quot; Well , the devil flay them , the privileged classes , &quot; his brother &apos;s voice responded , with a cough .
It was the letter he was expecting - from his mother , reproaching him for not having been to see her - and the note was from his brother to say that he must have a little talk with him .
And from a queer association of ideas , because in his imagination the idea of Sviazhsky &apos;s sister @-@ in @-@ law was connected with marriage , it occurred to him that there was no one to whom he could more suitably speak of his happiness , and he was very glad to go and see them .
In all he had painted and repainted he saw faults that hurt his eyes , coming from want of care in taking off the wrappings - faults he could not correct now without spoiling the whole .
She had gone to Ergushovo , the estate that had been her dowry , and the one where in spring the forest had been sold .
&quot; But how ? &quot; he added , with a gesture of his hands before his eyes not usual with him .
I wasn &apos;t dull .
The position seemed hopeless .
She was not forced to think what she was to do .
&quot; Well , what now ? &quot; he asked disconsolately .
I sat there a little , and went on by the forest to the village , met your old nurse , and sounded her as to the peasants &quot; view of you .
&quot; The conductor , forgetting the proverb , would have chucked me out on account of my attire ; but thereupon I began expressing my feelings in elevated language , and ... you , too , &quot; he said , addressing Karenin and forgetting his name , &quot; at first would have ejected me on the ground of the old coat , but afterwards you took my part , for which I am extremely grateful . &quot; &quot; The rights of passengers generally to choose their seats are too ill @-@ defined , &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch , rubbing the tips of his fingers on his handkerchief .
It was she .
The interests of his regiment took an important place in Vronsky &apos;s life , both because he was fond of the regiment , and because the regiment was fond of him .
awful ! &quot; he said .
&quot; Poor , unlucky fellow ! &quot; thought Levin , and tears came into his eyes from love and pity for this man .
She recalled not herself only , but all her women @-@ friends and acquaintances .
&quot; My , what a beauty !
Anyway , she didn &apos;t comprehend it when she was very young .
I think I &apos;m worse . &quot; &quot; _ Enfant terrible , enfant terrible ! _ &quot; repeated Betsy .
&quot; I &apos;ll be back directly , maman , &quot; he remarked , turning round in the doorway .
&quot; How if we were to change our program , Levin ? &quot; he said , keeping his finger on the bill of fare .
Then you had , let us say , the misfortune to love a man not your husband .
She felt that everything must be right of itself , and graceful , and nothing could need setting straight .
But the princess saw that her daughter was rushing into extremes , and so indeed she told her .
&quot; Well , you didn &apos;t expect me , eh ? &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , getting out of the sledge , splashed with mud on the bridge of his nose , on his cheek , and on his eyebrows , but radiant with health and good spirits .
A man could not be prevented from making himself a big wax doll , and kissing it .
And therefore , guided by precedents , I must inform you that in practice cases of divorce may all be reduced to the following - there &apos;s no physical defect , I may assume , nor desertion ? ... &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch bowed his head in assent .
The professor was carrying on a hot crusade against materialists .
He was afraid to look at me , but that is not all .... &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch would have referred to the bill that had been brought him , but his voice shook , and he stopped .
If one forgives , it must be completely , completely .
How are you , Arhip ! &quot; He shook hands with the peasant and sat down on the edge of a chair , without taking off his coat and hat .
He still lay down , trying to sleep , though he felt there was not the smallest hope of it , and kept repeating stray words from some chain of thought , trying by this to check the rising flood of fresh images .
But he was at once convinced that it was utterly impossible to him .
Now I see it all . &quot; &quot; Well , Darya Alexandrovna , you must excuse me , &quot; he said , getting up .
That &apos;s the best thing about every part of sport , that one has to do with nature .
And that &apos;s his punishment for something .
After all , it &apos;s one of the pleasures of life , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch .
But , Dolly , forgive me ! &quot; She sat down .
I see , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch .
It &apos;s all very well for you ; but for me , with a son to keep at the university , lads to be educated at the high school - how am I going to buy these dray @-@ horses ? &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s what the land banks are for . &quot; &quot; To get what &apos;s left me sold by auction ?
But now no physical craving or suffering received relief , and the effort to relieve them only caused fresh suffering .
The women were standing up waiting on them .
But she did not heed him , and would not agree to anything .
Eh ? &quot; &quot; Altogether , &quot; pursued Sergey Ivanovitch , &quot; you &apos;re satisfied with your day ? &quot; &quot; Quite satisfied .
&quot; Can it be possible we could be like husband and wife , alone , your family with you ? &quot; she said , looking close into his eyes .
&quot; The Grand Duchess asked him to give her the helmet ; he doesn &apos;t give it to her .
But yesterday there were special reasons , &quot; pursued Stepan Arkadyevitch , with a meaning smile , totally oblivious of the genuine sympathy he had felt the day before for his friend , and feeling the same sympathy now , only for Vronsky .
I went away , you see , because I made up my mind that it could never be , you understand , as a happiness that does not come on earth ; but I &apos;ve struggled with myself , I see there &apos;s no living without it .
&quot; He has begun picking at himself , &quot; said Marya Nikolaevna .
Is the house standing still , and the birch trees , and our schoolroom ?
She merely sent a brief note to her brother to tell him that he must not fail to dine at home .
Nowadays they will all go their own way , and mothers haven &apos;t a word to say in anything , and then .... &quot; &quot; Mamma , I &apos;ll go up to her . &quot; &quot; Well , do .
But it would be better to get to sleep . &quot; Anna said what came to her lips , and marveled , hearing herself , at her own capacity for lying .
&quot; Do you see that ?
I know it &apos;s not he that I love ; but still I am happy with him , and he &apos;s so jolly .
&quot; Why has she given up sending the children and coming to see us ? &quot; Kitty answered that nothing had happened between them , and that she could not tell why Anna Pavlovna seemed displeased with her .
She asked herself where she should go when she was turned out of the house , and she could not find an answer .
After a brief consultation - whether to take the rows lengthwise or diagonally - Prohor Yermilin , also a renowned mower , a huge , black @-@ haired peasant , went on ahead .
Something snapped in Darya Alexandrovna &apos;s heart when she saw this .
In Russia the question is that of the relation of the working people to the land ; though the question exists there too - but there it &apos;s a matter of repairing what &apos;s been ruined , while with us .... &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch listened attentively to Levin .
He &apos;s mute as a fish .
Their eyes met , and Vronsky gave him a friendly and encouraging nod .
It frightens her .
It &apos;s simply a scandal ! &quot; &quot; Oh , how unpleasant ! &quot; said the princess .
However often he told himself that he was in no wise to blame in it , that recollection , like other humiliating reminiscences of a similar kind , made him twinge and blush .
Chapter 16 When Levin went upstairs , his wife was sitting near the new silver samovar behind the new tea service , and , having settled old Agafea Mihalovna at a little table with a full cup of tea , was reading a letter from Dolly , with whom they were in continual and frequent correspondence .
&quot; I only wanted to give you Mother &apos;s letter .
&quot; I &apos;ll be back directly , &quot; and she ran back .
Un bijou ! _ &quot; And he moved gradually on , trying to draw her along with him .
She could not bring herself to call her maid , and still less go downstairs and see her son and his governess .
&quot; Well , I on the contrary expected less - I &apos;ll own frankly .
He was thinking now with pleasure and excitement of the race , of his being anyhow , in time , and now and then the thought of the blissful interview awaiting him that night flashed across his imagination like a flaming light .
&quot; Well , I &apos;m listening to what &apos;s to come , &quot; she said , calmly and ironically ; &quot; and indeed I listen with interest , for I should like to understand what &apos;s the matter . &quot; She spoke , and marveled at the confident , calm , and natural tone in which she was speaking , and the choice of the words she used .
She arranged the brushes , but she did it all so that there was nothing shocking in it .
He saw that Kitty was extraordinarily sweet when , laughing and crying , she came to tell him that her maid , Masha , was used to looking upon her as her young lady , and so no one obeyed her .
There , in the remote heights above , a mysterious change had been accomplished .
Or else it &apos;s too ridiculous . &quot; Without answering his words , Varya bent over him , and with a delighted smile gazed into his face .
Gladiator rose , with no sound of knocking against anything .
In a rapid glance she scanned his figure that beamed with health and freshness .
She felt that her fate was sealed .
For this reason there positively came into Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s face a look of haughtiness and severity whenever anyone inquired after his wife &apos;s health .
Varenka came , however , in the evening and brought a roll of music with her .
&quot; But you know I wrote to her ? &quot; &quot; Still she &apos;ll want to hear details .
&quot; In what way are schools going to help the people to improve their material position ?
How ever did you get along in a sledge ? &quot; &quot; In a cart it would have been worse still , Konstantin Dmitrievitch , &quot; answered the driver , who knew him .
I have never seen anything extraordinary , though I am always on the lookout for it everywhere , &quot; said Vronsky , smiling .
By him and his children .
He was happy , but not at all in the way he had expected to be .
&quot; I can &apos;t be more Catholic than the Pope , &quot; she said .
&quot; He will get angry , and will not listen to you , &quot; they used to say .
&quot; Volkov climbed onto the roof and began telling us how sad he was .
Have you ever seen his portrait of Madame Vassiltchikova ?
Is that possible ?
I really am not sure , &quot; Vronsky answered heedlessly , with a vague recollection of something stiff and tedious evoked by the name Karenina .
This is what I believe in , &quot; he said , and , squeezing the bottle in his bony hand , he began breathing over it .
Your picture is so fine that my observation cannot detract from it , and , besides , it is only my personal opinion .
And then !
He felt that this independent attitude of a man who might have done anything , but cared to do nothing , was already beginning to pall , that many people were beginning to fancy that he was not really capable of anything but being a straightforward , good @-@ natured fellow .
What do you want ?
&quot; Well , he turned up here soon after you &apos;d gone , and as I can see , he &apos;s over head and ears in love with Kitty , and you know that her mother .... &quot; &quot; Excuse me , but I know nothing , &quot; said Levin , frowning gloomily .
What is it you want ? &quot; He was not at all the same as Konstantin had been fancying him .
Laws against such young gallants there have always been , and there still are !
&quot; I am obliged to tell you , &quot; he began .
What would come of it all he did not know , he did not even think .
&quot; And can it be my fault , can I have done anything wrong ?
She strained every effort of her mind to say what ought to be said .
&quot; I ?
Oh , dear !
Levin for his part refrained from taking any vodka simply because he felt such a loathing of that Frenchwoman , all made up , it seemed , of false hair , _ poudre de riz , _ and _ vinaigre de toilette _ .
The family doctor gave her cod liver oil , then iron , then nitrate of silver , but as the first and the second and the third were alike in doing no good , and as his advice when spring came was to go abroad , a celebrated physician was called in .
In his presence they talked like acquaintances .
The paper with the discarded sketch on it was found , but it was dirty , and spotted with candle @-@ grease .
And he was continually , on various pretexts , going out of the room , and coming in again , because he was unable to remain alone .
His room was cold , but he was oppressed by heat .
Oh , but if ... if refusal &apos;s in store for me ! ...
Alexey , come here .
&quot; Extraordinarily late the raspberries are lasting this year . &quot; And in the happiest frame of mind Sviazhsky got up and walked off , apparently supposing the conversation to have ended at the very point when to Levin it seemed that it was only just beginning .
His appearance , changed by his civilian dress , was as fascinating to her as though she were some young girl in love .
&quot; You &apos;re punished , you see , for being late . &quot; &quot; Yes ; but how was it ?
&quot; Why aren &apos;t they independent men ? &quot; &quot; Simply because they have not , or have not had from birth , an independent fortune ; they &apos;ve not had a name , they &apos;ve not been close to the sun and center as we have .
And I see no chance before us of peace for me or for you .
&quot; But , &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch , smiling subtly , and addressing Karenin , &quot; One must allow that to weigh all the advantages and disadvantages of classical and scientific studies is a difficult task , and the question which form of education was to be preferred would not have been so quickly and conclusively decided if there had not been in favor of classical education , as you expressed it just now , its moral - _ disons le mot _ - anti @-@ nihilist influence . &quot; &quot; Undoubtedly . &quot; &quot; If it had not been for the distinctive property of anti @-@ nihilistic influence on the side of classical studies , we should have considered the subject more , have weighed the arguments on both sides , &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch with a subtle smile , &quot; we should have given elbow @-@ room to both tendencies .
You know how she takes everything to heart .
But in spite of that , his love was known to all the town ; everyone guessed with more or less confidence at his relations with Madame Karenina .
They could get no fowls ; old , purplish , stringy cocks were all they had for roasting and boiling .
Dolly took Tanya and Grisha to a children &apos;s ball at the Sarmatskys &quot; : Tanya was a French marquise . &quot; But Levin did not hear her .
Levin walked after him and often thought he must fall , as he climbed with a scythe up a steep cliff where it would have been hard work to clamber without anything .
Alexey Alexandrovitch went up to Anna and courteously offered her his arm .
In the shed there were five horses in their separate stalls , and Vronsky knew that his chief rival , Gladiator , a very tall chestnut horse , had been brought there , and must be standing among them .
Chapter 7 Vronsky and Anna had been traveling for three months together in Europe .
&quot; Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin , Count Alexey Kirillovitch Vronsky . &quot; Vronsky got up and , looking cordially at Levin , shook hands with him .
&quot; Is there any way out of such a position ?
it will _ come round _ . &quot; The point was that when Levin asked for his evening suit , Kouzma , his old servant , had brought him the coat , waistcoat , and everything that was wanted .
&quot; You don &apos;t say so ! &quot; &quot; And have you any children ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve had four ; I &apos;ve two living - a boy and a girl .
&quot; We have long been expecting you , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , going into his room and letting Levin &apos;s hand go as though to show that here all danger was over .
I see your agony , and I can &apos;t tell you how sorry I am for you !
Altogether Dolly fancied she was not in a placid state of mind , but in that worried mood , which Dolly knew well with herself , and which does not come without cause , and for the most part covers dissatisfaction with self .
&quot; I know how you do everything , &quot; answered Dolly .
You give me _ carte blanche ! _ &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll talk about it later on ; I &apos;ll look you up in Petersburg . &quot; Chapter 22 It was six o &apos;clock already , and so , in order to be there quickly , and at the same time not to drive with his own horses , known to everyone , Vronsky got into Yashvin &apos;s hired fly , and told the driver to drive as quickly as possible .
I &apos;ll tell you what .
But though he repeatedly plied Stepan Arkadyevitch with questions as to the possibility of obtaining a certificate without actually communicating , Stepan Arkadyevitch maintained that it was out of the question .
From the rooms came a constant , steady hum , as from a hive , and the rustle of movement ; and while on the landing between trees they gave last touches to their hair and dresses before the mirror , they heard from the ballroom the careful , distinct notes of the fiddles of the orchestra beginning the first waltz .
To go out with my wife and visitors to meet the herd .... My wife says , &quot; Kostya and I looked after that calf like a child . &quot; &quot; How can it interest you so much ? &quot; says a visitor .
&quot; You can &apos;t understand it ; for you men , who are free and make your own choice , it &apos;s always clear whom you love .
That &apos;s how I see it . &quot; &quot; But why so ?
It was essential for him to be with someone to talk to , so as not to be left alone , to kill time .
This evening it was not I observed it , but judging by the impression made on the company , everyone observed that your conduct and deportment were not altogether what could be desired . &quot; &quot; I positively don &apos;t understand , &quot; said Anna , shrugging her shoulders - &quot; He doesn &apos;t care , &quot; she thought .
Cord , too , scowled , and followed Vronsky almost at a trot .
Good @-@ bye , countess . &quot; And he and his sister stood still , looking for her maid .
That &apos;s all I have to say to you .
Alexey Alexandrovitch stood still and said nothing , but his face struck Stepan Arkadyevitch by its expression of an unresisting sacrifice .
There were two brothers .
He caught a glimpse of his mud @-@ stained face as he flashed by .
But when her father left them she made ready for what was the chief thing needful - to go to Kitty and console her .
&quot; Here &apos;s your husband . &quot; At that instant Alexey Alexandrovitch did in fact walk into the room with his calm , awkward gait .
Don &apos;t you trust me ?
Numerova wasn &apos;t at all bad .
I &apos;m no good at it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not that you &apos;re no good at it , &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch ; &quot; it is that you don &apos;t look at it as you should . &quot; &quot; Perhaps not , &quot; Levin answered dejectedly .
&quot; I have the misfortune , &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch began , &quot; to have been deceived in my married life , and I desire to break off all relations with my wife by legal means - that is , to be divorced , but to do this so that my son may not remain with his mother . &quot; The lawyer &apos;s gray eyes tried not to laugh , but they were dancing with irrepressible glee , and Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that it was not simply the delight of a man who has just got a profitable job : there was triumph and joy , there was a gleam like the malignant gleam he saw in his wife &apos;s eyes .
At last the passenger carriages rolled in , oscillating before coming to a standstill .
&quot; Are you going to stay in town long ? &quot; Kitty questioned him .
Two snipe , playing and chasing one another , and only whistling , not crying , flew straight at the very heads of the sportsmen .
Stremov says she does that as it is . &quot; &quot; But do tell me , please , I never could make it out , &quot; said Anna , after being silent for some time , speaking in a tone that showed she was not asking an idle question , but that what she was asking was of more importance to her than it should have been ; &quot; do tell me , please , what are her relations with Prince Kaluzhsky , Mishka , as he &apos;s called ?
All women , simply as women , were terrible and distasteful to him .
He sat with his coat unbuttoned over a white waistcoat , resting both elbows on the table , and while waiting for the steak he had ordered he looked at a French novel that lay open on his plate .
I &apos;m in torture .
When did you come ? &quot; Levin was silent , looking at the unknown faces of Oblonsky &apos;s two companions , and especially at the hand of the elegant Grinevitch , which had such long white fingers , such long yellow filbert @-@ shaped nails , and such huge shining studs on the shirt @-@ cuff , that apparently they absorbed all his attention , and allowed him no freedom of thought .
Very glad to see you . &quot; The old prince embraced Levin , and talking to him did not observe Vronsky , who had risen , and was serenely waiting till the prince should turn to him .
She crossed over to the big table and took part in the general conversation .
&quot; I do like it when he looks down at me from the height of his grandeur , or breaks off his learned conversation with me because I &apos;m a fool , or is condescending to me .
&quot; One may save anyone who does not want to be ruined ; but if the whole nature is so corrupt , so depraved , that ruin itself seems to be her salvation , what &apos;s to be done ? &quot; &quot; Anything , only not divorce ! &quot; answered Darya Alexandrovna &quot; But what is anything ? &quot; &quot; No , it is awful !
&quot; And so here I am going away , having made an enemy of Kitty , whom I liked so much !
These ladies belonged to a circle which , though of the highest society , was utterly hostile to that in which Anna moved .
As a child that has been hurt skips about , putting all his muscles into movement to drown the pain , in the same way Alexey Alexandrovitch needed mental exercise to drown the thoughts of his wife that in her presence and in Vronsky &apos;s , and with the continual iteration of his name , would force themselves on his attention .
Kitty , too , should , one would have supposed , have been interested in what they were saying of the rights and education of women .
The lawyer was a little , squat , bald man , with a dark , reddish beard , light @-@ colored long eyebrows , and an overhanging brow .
They gave the baby medicine , and it turned out that the baby was simply hungry : the nurse had no milk , sir . &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch pondered , and after standing still a few seconds he went in at the other door .
Peaceful with six children Darya Alexandrovna could not be .
&quot; Of one &apos;s soul &apos;s salvation we all know and must think before all else , &quot; she said with a sigh .
His good @-@ naturedly beaming face above the embroidered collar of his uniform beamed more than ever when he recognized the man coming up .
The childishness of her expression , together with the delicate beauty of her figure , made up her special charm , and that he fully realized .
&quot; Yes , of course , &quot; said Konstantin , looking at the patch of red that had come out on his brother &apos;s projecting cheekbones .
He was silent for a space .
Several times he tried to begin to speak , but stopped .
&quot; No , I must just run round to the counting @-@ house for a minute , &quot; Levin would answer , and he would run off to the fields .
The further he rode , the happier he became , and plans for the land rose to his mind each better than the last ; to plant all his fields with hedges along the southern borders , so that the snow should not lie under them ; to divide them up into six fields of arable and three of pasture and hay ; to build a cattle yard at the further end of the estate , and to dig a pond and to construct movable pens for the cattle as a means of manuring the land .
&quot; It &apos;s a long while since we &apos;ve seen you here , sir , &quot; said the attendant , supporting his foot , and screwing on the heel of the skate .
They gallop at full speed .
She did not let him go on .
&quot; Forgive me , if you dislike what I said , &quot; he said humbly .
She lifted her head and looked at him with a forced smile .
He lighted a candle , got up cautiously and went to the looking @-@ glass , and began looking at his face and hair .
As though she did not know which foot to put first , Frou @-@ Frou started , dragging at the reins with her long neck , and as though she were on springs , shaking her rider from side to side .
Levin only had time to tell him he was happy , and that he loved him , and would never , never forget what he had done for him .
There was the report of four shots , and like swallows the snipe turned swift somersaults in the air and vanished from sight .
Two clerks were writing at tables with scratching pens .
&quot; It &apos;s nothing ; I wanted you to look round , &quot; she said , watching him , and trying to guess whether he was vexed at being interrupted or not .
I &apos;ll go and have a look at them , &quot; he said , getting on to the little bay cob , Kolpik , who was led up by the coachman .
Are you really the exquisite creature I imagine you to be ?
Darya Alexandrovna listened , and her face suddenly softened .
But suddenly she heard the rustle of a skirt , and with it the sound of heart @-@ rending , smothered sobbing , and felt arms about her neck .
The only thing that interested him now was the question of in what way he could best , with most propriety and comfort for himself , and thus with most justice , extricate himself from the mud with which she had spattered him in her fall , and then proceed along his path of active , honorable , and useful existence .
One would fall ill , another might easily become so , a third would be without something necessary , a fourth would show symptoms of a bad disposition , and so on .
Vronsky was touching the ground with one foot , and his mare was sinking on that foot .
A perfect Samson ! &quot; &quot; I imagine great strength is needed for hunting bears , &quot; observed Alexey Alexandrovitch , who had the mistiest notions about the chase .
&quot; Oh , so that &apos;s it ? &quot; he said .
In the contrary event , you can conjecture what awaits you and your son .
&quot; But if only you knew how wretched I am !
Come now , what treasure have you been buying lately at the old curiosity shops ? &quot; &quot; Would you like me to show you ?
The princess had invited Marya Yevgenyevna and her daughter and the colonel .
There was a great deal more that was delightful , only there &apos;s no putting it into words , or even expressing it in one &apos;s thoughts awake . &quot; And noticing a gleam of light peeping in beside one of the serge curtains , he cheerfully dropped his feet over the edge of the sofa , and felt about with them for his slippers , a present on his last birthday , worked for him by his wife on gold @-@ colored morocco .
Before this , as soon as Kitty went out of the room in tears , Dolly , with her motherly , family instincts , had promptly perceived that here a woman &apos;s work lay before her , and she prepared to do it .
But I cannot live without it .
&quot; It &apos;s so stupid , what happened to me , I &apos;m ashamed to speak of it ! &quot; he said , reddening , and he was obliged to turn to Sergey Ivanovitch , who came up to him .
And now when he had learned to know her , to love her as she should be loved , he had been humiliated before her , and had lost her forever , leaving with her nothing of himself but a shameful memory .
You know what I shall say . &quot; &quot; But I want to hear your opinion . &quot; &quot; My opinion , &quot; answered Levin , &quot; is only that this table @-@ turning simply proves that educated society - so called - is no higher than the peasants .
&quot; Vasya Pryatchnikov , &quot; he said , with a good @-@ natured smile on his damp , red lips , addressing himself principally to the most important guest , Alexey Alexandrovitch , &quot; they told me today he fought a duel with Kvitsky at Tver , and has killed him . &quot; Just as it always seems that one bruises oneself on a sore place , so Stepan Arkadyevitch felt now that the conversation would by ill luck fall every moment on Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s sore spot .
I am glad .
What about ? &quot; she asked , sitting down .
He &apos;s very interesting . &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s this missionary ? &quot; &quot; Yes ; he told us about the life in India , most interesting things . &quot; The conversation , interrupted by her coming in , flickered up again like the light of a lamp being blown out .
I want to know everything .
&quot; I wrote to you and Sergey Ivanovitch both that I don &apos;t know you and don &apos;t want to know you .
He felt all the torture of his own and her position , all the difficulty there was for them , conspicuous as they were in the eye of all the world , in concealing their love , in lying and deceiving ; and in lying , deceiving , feigning , and continually thinking of others , when the passion that united them was so intense that they were both oblivious of everything else but their love .
as white as sugar , &quot; said one , admiring Tanitchka , and shaking her head ; &quot; but thin .... &quot; &quot; Yes , she has been ill . &quot; &quot; And so they &apos;ve been bathing you too , &quot; said another to the baby .
One @-@ third of the men in the government , the older men , had been friends of his father &apos;s , and had known him in petticoats ; another third were his intimate chums , and the remainder were friendly acquaintances .
But these ideas , once of such importance in his eyes , seemed to come into his brain as in a dream , and had now not the slightest interest for him .
Varenka flushed a little .
Flung himself ! ...
It &apos;ll look different .
And while out shooting , when he seemed to be thinking of nothing at all , suddenly the old man and his family kept coming back to his mind , and the impression of them seemed to claim not merely his attention , but the solution of some question connected with them .
An officer , buttoning his glove , stood aside in the doorway , and stroking his mustache , admired rosy Kitty .
Stepan Arkadyevitch crushed the starchy napkin , tucked it into his waistcoat , and settling his arms comfortably , started on the oysters .
We have gone our way - the European way - a long while , without asking ourselves about the qualities of our labor force .
There was only one creature in the world that could concentrate for him all the brightness and meaning of life .
There was no dust visible anywhere , a rug was laid by the bedside .
She took her seat in her husband &apos;s carriage in silence , and in silence drove out of the crowd of carriages .
The head deacon , as though to remind them of the value of his time , coughed impatiently , making the window @-@ panes quiver in their frames .
She glanced at her husband to find out whether he knew Vronsky .
It was evident to Levin that Sviazhsky knew an answer to this gentleman &apos;s complaints , which would at once demolish his whole contention , but that in his position he could not give utterance to this answer , and listened , not without pleasure , to the landowner &apos;s comic speeches .
In a little dirty room with the painted panels of its walls filthy with spittle , and conversation audible through the thin partition from the next room , in a stifling atmosphere saturated with impurities , on a bedstead moved away from the wall , there lay covered with a quilt , a body .
He was struggling for every farthing of his share ( and he could not help it , for he had only to relax his efforts , and he would not have had the money to pay his laborers &quot; wages ) , while they were only struggling to be able to do their work easily and agreeably , that is to say , as they were used to doing it .
On reaching the offices of the board , Stepan Arkadyevitch , escorted by a deferential porter with a portfolio , went into his little private room , put on his uniform , and went into the boardroom .
Christ is represented as a Jew with all the realism of the new school . &quot; And the question of the subject of the picture having brought him to one of his favorite theories , Golenishtchev launched forth into a disquisition on it .
To the spectators it seemed as though they had all started simultaneously , but to the racers there were seconds of difference that had great value to them .
&quot; Yes , yes , that &apos;s better , a thousand times better !
You see , I &apos;m engrossed with business !
&quot; What is she vexed with him about ? &quot; thought Kitty , discerning that Anna had intentionally not responded to Vronsky &apos;s bow .
&quot; One thing I do understand , &quot; he added ; &quot; it &apos;s a lesson in humility .
I am glad to see you ! &quot; he said , knocking one foot against the other to shake the snow off .
It seemed to her that the words that she had spoken to her husband , and had continually repeated in her imagination , she had said to everyone , and everyone had heard them .
His criticisms of Russian women , whom he wished to study , more than once made Vronsky crimson with indignation .
&quot; Sit down . &quot; &quot; Oh , don &apos;t trouble about the money .
She saw that girls of Kitty &apos;s age formed some sort of clubs , went to some sort of lectures , mixed freely in men &apos;s society ; drove about the streets alone , many of them did not curtsey , and , what was the most important thing , all the girls were firmly convinced that to choose their husbands was their own affair , and not their parents . &quot;
For some reason it was disagreeable to her to think of it .
Me go through a performance before her of forgiving , and deigning to bestow my love on her ! ...
He told his German valet , who ran up to him from the second class , to take his things and go on , and he himself went up to her .
When the doctors were left alone , the family doctor began timidly explaining his opinion , that there was a commencement of tuberculous trouble , but ... and so on .
But what &apos;s brought you up to town ? &quot; &quot; Oh , we &apos;ll talk about that , too , later on , &quot; said Levin , reddening again up to his ears .
Vronsky saw from her eyes that she did not know on what terms he cared to be with Golenishtchev , and so was afraid of not behaving as he would wish .
&quot; That must be Vronsky , &quot; thought Levin , and , to be sure of it , glanced at Kitty .
&quot; Well , since it &apos;s impossible tonight , let us start , &quot; she said , not noticing Vronsky &apos;s bow , and she hastily put her hand on Korsunsky &apos;s shoulder .
If I walk on tiptoe , he will be vexed ; to tread firmly , I &apos;m ashamed . &quot; Kitty evidently did not think of herself , and had no time to think about herself : she was thinking about him because she knew something , and all went well .
The cows had been let out into their paddock , and their smooth sides were already shining with their new , sleek , spring coats ; they basked in the sunshine and lowed to go to the meadow .
&quot; Let &apos;s skip that , &quot; said Varenka , flushing a little .
He took her hand and kissed it .
&quot; Where are you going ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to a meeting . &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ll come with you .
But when one wants to sell , no one will give anything .... No , I see you &apos;ve a grudge against that unlucky Ryabinin . &quot; &quot; Maybe I have .
The sick man said nothing .
&quot; I haven &apos;t slept all night , though , and I can &apos;t think it out clearly , &quot; he said to himself .
&quot; So that &apos;s what I think it is , my dear boy , &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch , touching him on the shoulder .
One so knows the man : a good @-@ natured , capital fellow , but an official through and through , who does not know what it is he &apos;s doing .
He could not believe that what gave such great and delicate pleasure to him , and above all to her , could be wrong .
And he &apos;s not ridiculous , and not affected ; one can see he &apos;s moved . &quot; &quot; You expected it , I suppose ? &quot; &quot; Almost .
Two boys were angling in the shade of a willow @-@ tree .
No interest in her work , in the estate , in the peasants , nor in music , though she &apos;s rather good at it , nor in reading .
He wanted to put one question to Stepan Arkadyevitch , but he could not bring himself to the point , and could not find the words or the moment in which to put it .
&quot; And what if the things have been taken on to the railway station ! &quot; he roared in desperation .
&quot; In another world !
&quot; I believe that it was ordained . &quot; &quot; And I ! &quot; she said .
&quot; I &apos;ll tell you what for ....
The grass was short close to the road , and Levin , who had not done any mowing for a long while , and was disconcerted by the eyes fastened upon him , cut badly for the first moments , though he swung his scythe vigorously .
Your wife gets older , while you &apos;re full of life .
She lifted her clear , truthful eyes , and seeing his desperate face , she answered hastily : &quot; That cannot be ... forgive me . &quot; A moment ago , and how close she had been to him , of what importance in his life !
He made an effort at thought , and was aware that he was on the floor ; and seeing blood on the tiger @-@ skin rug and on his arm , he knew he had shot himself .
&quot; I &apos;ve seen it , &quot; answered Golenishtchev .
He had not intended to go away next day , but he now determined to go home early in the morning .
Chapter 17 Unconsciously going over in his memory the conversations that had taken place during and after dinner , Alexey Alexandrovitch returned to his solitary room .
Her chief mental interest in the watering @-@ place consisted in watching and making theories about the people she did not know .
Her mother and father had consented without demur , and were happy in her happiness .
She was just the same as when he saw her in Moscow ; the same woolen gown , and bare arms and neck , and the same good @-@ naturedly stupid , pockmarked face , only a little plumper .
There was no place where they could bathe ; the whole of the river @-@ bank was trampled by the cattle and open to the road ; even walks were impossible , for the cattle strayed into the garden through a gap in the hedge , and there was one terrible bull , who bellowed , and therefore might be expected to gore somebody .
&quot; Why , what do I keep you for ? &quot; he cried .
At last the little girl kissed his face , which was flushed from his stooping posture and beaming with tenderness , loosed her hands , and was about to run away again ; but her father held her back .
I am .... &quot; &quot; That feeling is more than reciprocal , princess , &quot; Varenka answered hurriedly .
&quot; You understand everything , I see , and have taken stock of everything , and look with commiseration on my shortcomings , &quot; he began again , raising his voice .
Alexey Alexandrovitch would have made some reply , but tears stopped him .
the doctor plunged into deep meditation , as though resolving a weighty problem .
It &apos;s like scattering grain to the ducks , the way they pick it up ! &quot; he added , pointing to the growing haycocks .
She was weeping that her dream of her position being made clear and definite had been annihilated forever .
But , strange to say , although she had so made up her mind not to be influenced by her father &apos;s views , not to let him into her inmost sanctuary , she felt that the heavenly image of Madame Stahl , which she had carried for a whole month in her heart , had vanished , never to return , just as the fantastic figure made up of some clothes thrown down at random vanishes when one sees that it is only some garment lying there .
She did not very much like it that he , who was in love with her daughter , had kept coming to the house for six weeks , as though he were waiting for something , inspecting , as though he were afraid he might be doing them too great an honor by making an offer , and did not realize that a man , who continually visits at a house where there is a young unmarried girl , is bound to make his intentions clear .
Alexey Alexandrovitch noticed it and asked : &quot; Who is here ? &quot; &quot; The doctor , the midwife , and Count Vronsky . &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch went into the inner rooms .
To this doubt there was joined the change in her relations with the Petrovs , which had been so conspicuously and unpleasantly marked that morning .
I expected to see you there , &quot; said Vronsky , scrutinizing Serpuhovskoy .
&quot; Oh , you &apos;ve come , &quot; he said , addressing a tall old footman of his mother &apos;s , standing at the door ; &quot; come here . &quot; Besides the charm Oblonsky had in general for everyone , Vronsky had felt of late specially drawn to him by the fact that in his imagination he was associated with Kitty .
&quot; I was greatly delighted to hear of your success , but not a bit surprised .
And she blushed for her father .
The princess had grown accustomed to this already with her other daughters , but now she felt that there was more ground for the prince &apos;s touchiness .
They had race horses , and Russian pancakes and bear hunts and three @-@ horse sledges , and gypsies and drinking feasts , with the Russian accompaniment of broken crockery .
&quot; _ Timber , run to so many yards the acre . _ &quot; He says those words without understanding them himself . &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t attempt to teach you what you write about in your office , &quot; said he , &quot; and if need arose , I should come to you to ask about it .
There was a split in the commission .
&quot; Petritsky &apos;s becoming impossible .
You only take me , take me to him , please , and go away , &quot; she said .
&quot; Your tears mean nothing !
&quot; Excuse me , &quot; he added , taking an opera @-@ glass out of her hand , and proceeding to scrutinize , over her bare shoulder , the row of boxes facing them .
&quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch , &quot; said Vronsky , feeling that a statement of the position was coming , &quot; I can &apos;t speak , I can &apos;t understand .
&quot; &quot; Nothing , &quot; &quot; he put in with a subtle smile , &quot; that &apos;s the very best way .
That &apos;s how it is with this . &quot; &quot; Will you be at Madame Rolandak &apos;s fête ? &quot; asked Anna , to change the conversation .
As he ran with the children , he taught them gymnastic feats , set Miss Hoole laughing with his queer English accent , and talked to Darya Alexandrovna of his pursuits in the country .
She was the smile that shed light on all round her .
&quot; There &apos;s so much splendor here that one &apos;s eyes are dazzled , &quot; he said , and he went into the pavilion .
Levin half smiled .
Now while he held his letter in his hands , he could not help picturing the challenge , which he would most likely find at home today or tomorrow , and the duel itself , in which , with the same cold and haughty expression that his face was assuming at this moment he would await the injured husband &apos;s shot , after having himself fired into the air .
In the dining @-@ room he was met by Konstantin Levin .
He passed in review of the places he might go to .
The priest , on finishing the prayer , put the cross to the cold forehead , then slowly returned it to the stand , and after standing for two minutes more in silence , he touched the huge , bloodless hand that was turning cold .
Stiva ! &quot; Dolly called , reddening .
Chapter 3 When he was dressed , Stepan Arkadyevitch sprinkled some scent on himself , pulled down his shirt @-@ cuffs , distributed into his pockets his cigarettes , pocketbook , matches , and watch with its double chain and seals , and shaking out his handkerchief , feeling himself clean , fragrant , healthy , and physically at ease , in spite of his unhappiness , he walked with a slight swing on each leg into the dining @-@ room , where coffee was already waiting for him , and beside the coffee , letters and papers from the office .
Let them go their way , and me go mine .
The birds twittered more and more loudly and busily in the thicket .
The horses who had run in the last race were being led home , steaming and exhausted , by the stable @-@ boys , and one after another the fresh horses for the coming race made their appearance , for the most part English racers , wearing horsecloths , and looking with their drawn @-@ up bellies like strange , huge birds .
And mending the highroads is an impossibility ; and as soon as they put up bridges they &apos;re stolen . &quot; &quot; Still , that &apos;s not the point , &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch , frowning .
&quot; No , this can &apos;t go on ! &quot; he said to himself in despair .
She , wearing the dark lilac dress she had worn during the first days of their married life , and put on again today , a dress particularly remembered and loved by him , was sitting on the sofa , the same old @-@ fashioned leather sofa which had always stood in the study in Levin &apos;s father &apos;s and grandfather &apos;s days .
And she must act ; act to secure this relation to her son , so that he might not be taken from her .
&quot; Oh , do shut up , Yashvin ! &quot; he said , getting furious with Yashvin , who was pulling the rug off him .
For gracious and merciful art Thou , our Lord , and glory be to Thee , the Father , the Son , and the Holy Ghost , now and ever shall be . &quot; &quot; Amen ! &quot; the unseen choir sent rolling again upon the air .
The beauty of her whole figure , her head , her neck , her hands , struck Vronsky every time as something new and unexpected .
You are ill ? &quot; he said to her in French , going up to her .
If I could take from off you all these petty , humiliating cares ...
Become a member of a peasant community ?
All the skaters , it seemed , with perfect self @-@ possession , skated towards her , skated by her , even spoke to her , and were happy , quite apart from her , enjoying the capital ice and the fine weather .
&quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; he said .
With you it is different .
&quot; One can see that He is pitying Pilate . &quot; This again was one of the million true reflections that could be found in his picture and in the figure of Christ .
Table @-@ turning ?
As though tears were the indispensable oil , without which the machinery of mutual confidence could not run smoothly between the two sisters , the sisters after their tears talked , not of what was uppermost in their minds , but , though they talked of outside matters , they understood each other .
And he wanted to prove this theoretically in his book and practically on his land .
This coarseness of his angered her , and gave her courage .
But when he got out at his own station , when he saw his one @-@ eyed coachman , Ignat , with the collar of his coat turned up ; when , in the dim light reflected by the station fires , he saw his own sledge , his own horses with their tails tied up , in their harness trimmed with rings and tassels ; when the coachman Ignat , as he put in his luggage , told him the village news , that the contractor had arrived , and that Pava had calved , - he felt that little by little the confusion was clearing up , and the shame and self @-@ dissatisfaction were passing away .
I heard today that my brother Nikolay ... you know , he &apos;s here ...
&quot; This gentleman is a Russian , and was inquiring after you , &quot; said the head waiter .
Chapter 20 Alexey Alexandrovitch took leave of Betsy in the drawing @-@ room , and went to his wife .
She was not so gay and thoughtless as before , but she was serene .
Then the colonel , who began to show signs of feebleness , sat down on a bench in the courtyard and began demonstrating to Yashvin the superiority of Russia over Prussia , especially in cavalry attack , and there was a lull in the revelry for a moment .
He approached with timidity , but again her smile reassured him .
But still I shall take him .
And I consider my idea very important , but it turns out really to be as unimportant too , even if it were carried out , as doing for that bear .
He was just going in , stepping on his whole foot so as not to creak , up the worn steps of the terrace , when he suddenly remembered what he always forgot , and what caused the most torturing side of his relations with her , her son with his questioning - hostile , as he fancied - eyes .
As he had from a child a taste for painting , and as , not knowing what to spend his money on , he had begun collecting engravings , he came to a stop at painting , began to take interest in it , and concentrated upon it the unoccupied mass of desires which demanded satisfaction .
&quot; I have long wished for this too , &quot; she said .
That man did drown .
The thought of the harm caused to her husband aroused in her a feeling like repulsion , and akin to what a drowning man might feel who has shaken off another man clinging to him .
I need nothing . &quot; Annushka went out , but Anna did not begin dressing , and sat in the same position , her head and hands hanging listlessly , and every now and then she shivered all over , seemed as though she would make some gesture , utter some word , and sank back into lifelessness again .
Ivan , obviously doing his best to save her every minute of unnecessary labor , made haste , opening his arms to clutch the bundle and lay it in the cart .
&quot; Oh , if you don &apos;t want to say , don &apos;t .
So much the worse for you ! &quot; he said mentally , like a man who , after vainly attempting to extinguish a fire , should fly in a rage with his vain efforts and say , &quot; Oh , very well then !
He could not comprehend the meaning of the change .
And on Vronsky &apos;s face , always so firm and independent , she saw that look that had struck her , of bewilderment and humble submissiveness , like the expression of an intelligent dog when it has done wrong .
Chapter 23 On Monday there was the usual sitting of the Commission of the 2nd of June .
Next morning , Tuesday , Alexey Alexandrovitch , on waking up , recollected with pleasure his triumph of the previous day , and he could not help smiling , though he tried to appear indifferent , when the chief secretary of his department , anxious to flatter him , informed him of the rumors that had reached him concerning what had happened in the Commission .
The tradition is kept up here that you are the best of skaters , &quot; she said , with her little black @-@ gloved hand brushing a grain of hoarfrost off her muff .
They went out together .
He could not be at peace because after dreaming so long of family life , and feeling himself so ripe for it , he was still not married , and was further than ever from marriage .
After dinner , when Dolly went away to her own room , Anna rose quickly and went up to her brother , who was just lighting a cigar .
He talked to her as people commonly do talk in society - all sorts of nonsense , but nonsense to which he could not help attaching a special meaning in her case .
I &apos;ll break through the spiderweb of lies in which he wants to catch me , come what may .
And returning to her own room , in terror before the unknown future , she , too , like Kitty , repeated several times in her heart , &quot; Lord , have pity ; Lord , have pity ; Lord , have pity . &quot; Chapter 16 Vronsky had never had a real home life .
The recollection of his wife &apos;s last act had so incensed him that he had become frigid , as at the beginning of the conversation .
I &apos;ve done nothing , and could do nothing .
&quot; Dear friend ! &quot; she said in a voice breaking with emotion .
And you must give up thinking so directly ! &quot; said Kitty .
I forgive completely .
That &apos;s like scarlatina - one has to go through it and get it over . &quot; &quot; Then they ought to find out how to vaccinate for love , like smallpox . &quot; &quot; I was in love in my young days with a deacon , &quot; said the Princess Myakaya .
Fearfully rich , handsome , great connections , an aide @-@ de @-@ camp , and with all that a very nice , good @-@ natured fellow .
The whole party were in the wide lower balcony .
PART FOUR Chapter 1 The Karenins , husband and wife , continued living in the same house , met every day , but were complete strangers to one another .
&quot; Thank God , thank God ! &quot; she said , &quot; now everything is ready .
And here almost three months have passed , and I have spent my time so idly and unprofitably .
While he was turning him over , conscious of the huge emaciated arm about his neck , Kitty swiftly and noiselessly turned the pillow , beat it up and settled in it the sick man &apos;s head , smoothing back his hair , which was sticking again to his moist brow .
And on that delicious spring day he felt that the thought of her did not hurt him at all .
And , putting on his coat as he went , he patted the footman on the head , chuckled , and went out .
There &apos;s no position from which there is no way of escape . &quot; &quot; I have thought , and thought .
&quot; Certainly , your excellency ; tea to be served in the study ? &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch ordered tea to be brought to the study , and playing with the massive paper @-@ knife , he moved to his easy chair , near which there had been placed ready for him a lamp and the French work on Egyptian hieroglyphics that he had begun .
A companion , she must be .
Thought , till then locked up , began to stir in Levin &apos;s head , but he made haste to drive it away .
She &apos;s a wench , and you &apos;re a gentleman , &quot; he said with a jerk of the neck .
Catching sight of Kitty going away , and her mother meeting her at the steps , Levin , flushed from his rapid exercise , stood still and pondered a minute .
Her eye , full of fire , glanced sideways at Vronsky .
Having attained success and an established position in the world , he had long ago forgotten this feeling ; but the habitual bent of feeling reasserted itself , and dread of his own cowardice proved even now so strong that Alexey Alexandrovitch spent a long while thinking over the question of dueling in all its aspects , and hugging the idea of a duel , though he was fully aware beforehand that he would never under any circumstances fight one .
The matchmaking aunt had ascertained and communicated their mutual impression .
&quot; What ?
Levin , Kitty , and Marya Nikolaevna stood at the bedside .
During the last few days he had not ridden her out for exercise himself , but had put her in the charge of the trainer , and so now he positively did not know in what condition his mare had arrived yesterday and was today .
He bent down to her and took her hand , which resisted him .
Then he had thought himself unhappy , but happiness was before him ; now he felt that the best happiness was already left behind .
He attempted to look at it all as an empty custom , having no sort of meaning , like the custom of paying calls .
Chapter 26 Sviazhsky was the marshal of his district .
&quot; How is it you have deigned to look me up in this den ? &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , and not content with shaking hands , he kissed his friend .
Everything depends on their food . &quot; And Levin , to turn the conversation , explained to Darya Alexandrovna the theory of cow @-@ keeping , based on the principle that the cow is simply a machine for the transformation of food into milk , and so on .
She could not accompany herself , but she could sing music at sight very well .
Seizing the first pretext , she got up , and with her light , resolute step went for her album .
I &apos;m very glad , anyway , that I persuaded him , &quot; she said , looking askance at her husband through her hair .
The sky had grown blue and bright ; and with the same softness , but with the same remoteness , it met his questioning gaze .
The prince , on the contrary , thought everything foreign detestable , got sick of European life , kept to his Russian habits , and purposely tried to show himself abroad less European than he was in reality .
&quot; Anna and sin - I cannot connect them , I cannot believe it ! &quot; &quot; Darya Alexandrovna , &quot; he said , now looking straight into Dolly &apos;s kindly , troubled face , and feeling that his tongue was being loosened in spite of himself , &quot; I would give a great deal for doubt to be still possible .
&quot; You must understand that it &apos;s a question of life and death for me .
Madame Stahl belonged to the highest society , but she was so ill that she could not walk , and only on exceptionally fine days made her appearance at the springs in an invalid carriage .
She seemed to be wanting , and not daring , to tell him something ; and as though foreseeing their present relations could not continue , she seemed to be expecting something from him .
She was just attempting to do what she had attempted to do ten times already in these last three days - to sort out the children &apos;s things and her own , so as to take them to her mother &apos;s - and again she could not bring herself to do this ; but now again , as each time before , she kept saying to herself , &quot; that things cannot go on like this , that she must take some step &quot; to punish him , put him to shame , avenge on him some little part at least of the suffering he had caused her .
They were mowing slowly over the uneven , low @-@ lying parts of the meadow , where there had been an old dam .
She &apos;s coming for me . &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch knit his brows at Betsy &apos;s name .
In his walk , in his gestures , in the sound of his voice there was a determination and firmness such as his wife had never seen in him .
The bridegroom was expected at the church while he was pacing up and down his room like a wild beast in a cage , peeping out into the corridor , and with horror and despair recalling what absurd things he had said to Kitty and what she might be thinking now .
Thinking over what he would say , he somewhat regretted that he should have to use his time and mental powers for domestic consumption , with so little to show for it , but , in spite of that , the form and contents of the speech before him shaped itself as clearly and distinctly in his head as a ministerial report .
&quot; What are you reading now ? &quot; she asked .
Stepan Arkadyevitch approached him cautiously , whispered something , and making a sign to Levin , walked back again .
Vronsky stepped out onto the platform and shouted : &quot; Oblonsky !
In the elasticity of her movements , the freshness and the unflagging eagerness which persisted in her face , and broke out in her smile and her glance , she would rather have passed for a girl of twenty , had it not been for a serious and at times mournful look in her eyes , which struck and attracted Kitty .
Levin in self @-@ defense began to describe what took place in the meetings in his district .
That summer Levin saw this at every step .
She knew that this was how it would be , and at the same time it was so awful that she could not even conceive what it would end in .
&quot; What &apos;s become of all that ?
&quot; Leave him to me , &quot; she said to the astonished governess , and not letting go of her son , she sat down at the table , where coffee was set ready for her .
&quot; How are you living ? &quot; &quot; I live alone in the country , as I used to .
But the doctor , a celebrated Petersburg doctor , who was an intimate acquaintance of Alexey Alexandrovitch , took up a great deal of time .
Where ?
&quot; Can I tell him I don &apos;t love him ?
Taking a run , he dashed down the steps in his skates , crashing and bounding up and down .
&quot; I want you to go to Moscow and ask for Kitty &apos;s forgiveness , &quot; she said .
They were speaking of common acquaintances , keeping up the most trivial conversation , but to Kitty it seemed that every word they said was determining their fate and hers .
&quot; If there was anything on her side at the time , it was nothing but a superficial attraction , &quot; pursued Oblonsky .
At the bitterest moment of his lonely despair she came to him , and without waiting to be announced , walked straight into his study .
She knew that characteristic in her husband , and liked it .
The servants , the governess , the accounts ....
Tell me what you &apos;ve been doing ?
When , after her separation from her husband , she gave birth to her only child , the child had died almost immediately , and the family of Madame Stahl , knowing her sensibility , and fearing the news would kill her , had substituted another child , a baby born the same night and in the same house in Petersburg , the daughter of the chief cook of the Imperial Household .
&quot; Well , have you found your brother ? &quot; said Countess Vronskaya , addressing the lady .
But as Golenishtchev began to lay down his opinions and Vronsky was able to follow them even without knowing the _ Two Elements _ , he listened to him with some interest , for Golenishtchev spoke well .
Below , near the pavilion , was standing an adjutant @-@ general of whom Alexey Alexandrovitch had a high opinion , noted for his intelligence and culture .
Petritsky was a young lieutenant , not particularly well @-@ connected , and not merely not wealthy , but always hopelessly in debt .
On finishing his work , he returned home at four .
The question stands thus : in presence of indications of tuberculous process , what is to be done to maintain nutrition ? &quot; &quot; But , you know , there are always moral , spiritual causes at the back in these cases , &quot; the family doctor permitted himself to interpolate with a subtle smile .
&quot; I only want to say that to raise hopes .... &quot; &quot; Mamma , darling , for goodness &quot; sake , don &apos;t talk about it .
I am going to see her now , &quot; he said in French , carefully scrutinizing Golenishtchev &apos;s face .
And they don &apos;t sanction the gentry &apos;s moving outside bounds clearly laid down in their ideas . &quot; &quot; Maybe so ; but anyway it &apos;s a pleasure such as I have never known in my life .
&quot; Well , but what did you buy this mass of things for ? &quot; said the princess , smiling , and handing her husband a cup of coffee .
He went towards the pavilions at the most favorable moment for escaping attention .
It had survived everything , and stood up vividly green through the broken stalks of last year &apos;s wheat .
But the memory of that race remained for long in his heart , the cruelest and bitterest memory of his life .
The first person he saw was Mademoiselle Linon .
But for this prince he was an inferior , and his contemptuous and indulgent attitude to him revolted him .
They knew his open @-@ handedness ; and half an hour later the invalid doctor from Hamburg , who lived on the top floor , looked enviously out of the window at the merry party of healthy Russians assembled under the chestnut tree .
&quot; You &apos;re a nice person ! &quot; she said to Levin .
When I doubted , I was miserable , but it was better than now .
&quot; Well , have you seen him ? &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch with a malignant smile .
He saw out of the window how she went up to her brother , put her arm in his , and began telling him something eagerly , obviously something that had nothing to do with him , Vronsky , and at that he felt annoyed .
&quot; Yes , I used once to skate with passion ; I wanted to reach perfection . &quot; &quot; You do everything with passion , I think , &quot; she said smiling .
Many of his old ideas seemed to him superfluous and extreme , but many blanks became distinct to him when he reviewed the whole thing in his memory .
But in spite of his habitually dissipated mode of life , his inferior grade in the service , and his comparative youth , he occupied the honorable and lucrative position of president of one of the government boards at Moscow .
One thing only could and ought to be done , and Vronsky determined upon it without an instant &apos;s hesitation : to borrow money from a money @-@ lender , ten thousand roubles , a proceeding which presented no difficulty , to cut down his expenses generally , and to sell his race horses .
our conversation yesterday ? &quot; said Levin , blissfully dropping his eyelids and drawing deep breaths after finishing his dinner , and absolutely incapable of recalling what their conversation yesterday was about .
&quot; Then you must put on mine . &quot; &quot; I ought to have done so long ago , if at all . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not nice to look ridiculous ....
&quot; Have they come from the town ? &quot; Levin asked Kouzma .
There would be fresh perch , asparagus , and _ la pièce de resistance _ - first @-@ rate , but quite plain , roast beef , and wines to suit : so much for the eating and drinking .
How can you have so little self @-@ respect ? &quot; &quot; Self @-@ respect ! &quot; said Levin , stung to the quick by his brother &apos;s words ; &quot; I don &apos;t understand .
&quot; Coming , coming ! &quot; He went in to his wife .
Levin had more than once already tried a way he knew for stifling his anger , and turning all that seemed dark right again , and he tried that way now .
Well , and how &apos;s Buzulukov ? &quot; &quot; Oh , there is a tale about Buzulukov - simply lovely ! &quot; cried Petritsky .
Whom to take with me ?
&quot; It is so . &quot; &quot; Excuse me , I can &apos;t , I can &apos;t believe it ! &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch sat down , feeling that his words had not had the effect he anticipated , and that it would be unavoidable for him to explain his position , and that , whatever explanations he might make , his relations with his brother @-@ in @-@ law would remain unchanged .
The mowers from all sides , brought closer together in the short row , kept urging one another on to the sound of jingling dippers and clanging scythes , and the hiss of the whetstones sharpening them , and good @-@ humored shouts .
Vronsky and Anna too said something in that subdued voice in which , partly to avoid hurting the artist &apos;s feelings and partly to avoid saying out loud something silly - so easily said when talking of art - people usually speak at exhibitions of pictures .
&quot; The princess ... the prince ... the young princess .... &quot; said Levin .
He &apos;s a very nervous man , and is sometimes out of humor , it &apos;s true , but then he is often very nice .
Vronsky bowed , and Alexey Alexandrovitch , chewing his lips , lifted his hand to his hat and went on .
The great barrier stood just in front of the imperial pavilion .
Under the holy pictures stood a table painted in patterns , a bench , and two chairs .
&quot; How nice you &apos;ve come in good time , &quot; he said to her , embracing her waist ; &quot; such a bad habit to be late . &quot; Bending her left hand , she laid it on his shoulder , and her little feet in their pink slippers began swiftly , lightly , and rhythmically moving over the slippery floor in time to the music .
It &apos;s untidy enough without that , &quot; she said , putting up a straying lock , which Grisha had been playing with .
And what he saw then , he never saw again after .
&quot; Yashvin told me you were in one of your gloomy tempers . &quot; Serpuhovskoy kissed the moist , fresh lips of the gallant @-@ looking quartermaster , and wiping his mouth with his handkerchief , went up to Vronsky .
&quot; Oh no , don &apos;t say nothing else to do ! &quot; she said .
how can we be reconciled ? &quot; he said aloud , and unconsciously began to repeat these words .
On the right was led in Frou @-@ Frou , lean and beautiful , lifting up her elastic , rather long pasterns , as though moved by springs .
Varenka felt inclined to smile , looking at her childish fury , but she was afraid of wounding her .
She recalled the timid , softened look with which he gazed at her , and the strange feeling of compassion and awkwardness , and later of a sense of her own goodness , which she had felt at it .
&quot; Oh , how exquisite !
Darya Alexandrovna felt disinclined to leave the peasant women , so interesting to her was their conversation , so completely identical were all their interests .
Flushing , he took the letter from Marya Nikolaevna , his brother &apos;s former mistress , and began to read it .
She had nothing left her but his love , and she wanted to love him .
Moreover , this question on Levin &apos;s part was not quite in good faith .
One circle was her husband &apos;s government official set , consisting of his colleagues and subordinates , brought together in the most various and capricious manner , and belonging to different social strata .
&quot; Well , enough of Sergey Ivanovitch .
Everyone knows her and Aline Stahl . &quot; &quot; Perhaps so , &quot; said the prince , squeezing her hand with his elbow ; &quot; but it &apos;s better when one does good so that you may ask everyone and no one knows . &quot; Kitty did not answer , not because she had nothing to say , but because she did not care to reveal her secret thoughts even to her father .
&quot; Anna , is this you ? &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch , quietly making an effort over himself , and restraining the motion of his fingers .
The sense of longing for his death was felt by everyone now at the mere sight of him , by the waiters and the hotel @-@ keeper and all the people staying in the hotel , and the doctor and Marya Nikolaevna and Levin and Kitty .
But before the mazurka , when they were beginning to rearrange the chairs and a few couples moved out of the smaller rooms into the big room , a moment of despair and horror came for Kitty .
He raised his head , and fell to dreaming .
&quot; Come , so we shall see all your friends , &quot; he went on , &quot; even Madame Stahl , if she deigns to recognize me . &quot; &quot; Why , did you know her , papa ? &quot; Kitty asked apprehensively , catching the gleam of irony that kindled in the prince &apos;s eyes at the mention of Madame Stahl .
Kouzma , waked up by her , came sidling sleepily out onto the steps .
&quot; Oh , please , don &apos;t do that , I do so dislike it , &quot; she said .
Wait a little ! &quot; he called to a clerk who put his head in at the door , but he got up all the same , said a few words to him , and sat down again .
how sweet and silly he is !
Countess Lidia Ivanovna once more pressed both her friend &apos;s hands .
&quot; And these fools of open waistcoats !
Nikolay expressed pleasure , but said he was afraid of frightening her by his condition .
He got up and began walking about the room .
What have I done , and what could I do ?
I can tell you it all beforehand , &quot; and a wicked light gleamed in her eyes , that had been so soft a minute before .
&quot; I &apos;ve promised , and I &apos;ll come , &quot; he answered wearily .
the bankers ... they &apos;ve some splendid engravings .
And at that instant there flashed across his mind the thought of what Serpuhovskoy had just said to him , and what he had himself been thinking in the morning - that it was better not to bind himself - and he knew that this thought he could not tell her .
You don &apos;t want me to - why not ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say that , &quot; said Varenka quietly .
He did not go up the steps to the street door , but went into the court .
Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled .
I .... &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going because my brother is dying , &quot; said Levin .
Chapter 9 It was past five , and several guests had already arrived , before the host himself got home .
But while she looked like a butterfly , clinging to a blade of grass , and just about to open its rainbow wings for fresh flight , her heart ached with a horrible despair .
She &apos;s marvelous , &quot; he went on , speaking of a new French actress .
In reality , what was the struggle about ?
His father he scarcely remembered , and he had been educated in the Corps of Pages .
At four o &apos;clock he heard steps in the passage and peeped out at the door .
One of the bridegroom &apos;s best men went to find out what had happened .
Grisha ! &quot; said their mother , trying to save the frock , but with tears in her eyes , smiling a blissful , rapturous smile .
From all these considerations Anna had not meant to go , and the hints in Princess Tverskaya &apos;s note referred to her refusal .
We go into everything ourselves .
After crossing the stream Vronsky had complete control of his mare , and began holding her in , intending to cross the great barrier behind Mahotin , and to try to overtake him in the clear ground of about five hundred yards that followed it .
And , strange to say , what had had such weight with him , while they were there and while he mentally put himself at their point of view , suddenly lost all importance for him .
Only I can &apos;t understand how he could , to please his mother , forget you and make you unhappy ; he had no heart . &quot; &quot; Oh , no , he &apos;s a very good man , and I &apos;m not unhappy ; quite the contrary , I &apos;m very happy .
She only sat down when she felt too tired and begged for a rest .
He accused the professor of making too great concessions to the materialists .
At home in our village of Kaluga all the peasants and all the women have drunk up all they possessed , and now they can &apos;t pay us any rent .
The sound of the carriage @-@ springs was no longer audible , the bells could scarcely be heard .
Like a man half @-@ awake in an agony of pain , he wanted to tear out , to fling away the aching place , and coming to his senses , he felt that the aching place was himself .
&quot; Not a word more , &quot; she repeated , and with a look of chill despair , incomprehensible to him , she parted from him .
Kitty knew that the princess was offended that Madame Stahl had seemed to avoid making her acquaintance .
&quot; It &apos;s strange , but there are .
&quot; Let me introduce you . &quot; He mentioned their names .
&quot; Not one , on my honor .
My wife &apos;s expecting you .
&quot; He was fumbling and kept talking quickly , quickly in French , you know : _ Il faut le battre , le fer , le broyer , le pétrir _ .... And in my horror I tried to wake up , and woke up ... but woke up in the dream .
And he saw this by the suppressed , malicious , and ironical smile with which Betsy glanced at him after this phrase .
Can that be possible ? &quot; thought Levin , gazing at her .
&quot; Just as though I should seek the right to be a wet @-@ nurse and feel injured because women are paid for the work , while no one will take me , &quot; said the old prince .
Everyone looking into those eyes fancied he knew her wholly , and knowing her , could not but love her .
That &apos;s just how it is with us .
Chapter 24 When Vronsky looked at his watch on the Karenins &quot; balcony , he was so greatly agitated and lost in his thoughts that he saw the figures on the watch &apos;s face , but could not take in what time it was .
How are you to act ?
Besides , it &apos;s not true that it doesn &apos;t answer .
&quot; On one side it &apos;s a plaything ; they play at being a parliament , and I &apos;m neither young enough nor old enough to find amusement in playthings ; and on the other side &quot; ( he stammered ) &quot; it &apos;s a means for the coterie of the district to make money .
&quot; Ah !
take away ! &quot; he called to the Tatar .
Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed .
It &apos;s not looked after enough - that &apos;s all it is ! &quot; &quot; But you work your land with hired laborers ? &quot; &quot; We &apos;re all peasants together .
What is the matter ? &quot; &quot; What I have said a thousand times over , and can &apos;t help thinking ... that I &apos;m not worthy of you .
Stepan Arkadyevitch could not answer , as the barber was at work on his upper lip , and he raised one finger .
&quot; You &apos;re always .... &quot; she began a string of reproaches .
There was apparently nothing extraordinary in what she said , but what unutterable meaning there was for him in every sound , in every turn of her lips , her eyes , her hand as she said it !
For the demi @-@ monde the members of that fashionable world believed that they despised , though their tastes were not merely similar , but in fact identical .
That &apos;s the point of the whole situation , &quot; he reflected .
&quot; The despair you were unable to conceal at the accident to one of the riders . &quot; He waited for her to answer , but she was silent , looking straight before her .
But the chief thing was having to settle this . &quot; &quot; Well , God help you ! &quot; said Betsy .
And she cried without restraint , as children cry when they are punished .
How often he had told himself that her love was happiness ; and now she loved him as a woman can love when love has outweighed for her all the good things of life - and he was much further from happiness than when he had followed her from Moscow .
So we cut our nails ; sometimes we turn up our sleeves .
She was glad she had not gone out anywhere , and had spent the evening so well .
&quot; Mamma , &quot; she said , flushing hotly and turning quickly to her , &quot; please , please don &apos;t say anything about that .
Levin was utterly at a loss to comprehend or recall what it was he had disliked in Sviazhsky , what he had failed to find in him .
&quot; I ? ...
He had written this diary at the time with a view to his future wife .
Do you hear ?
Some men only understand one sort , and some only the other .
Let me tell you candidly my opinion . &quot; Again he smiled discreetly his almond @-@ oil smile .
Mahotin &apos;s the only one that &apos;s risky . &quot; And the conversation passed to forecasts of the coming race , the only thing Vronsky could think of just now .
Will you take red wine ? &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch .
Round the samovar and the hostess the conversation had been meanwhile vacillating in just the same way between three inevitable topics : the latest piece of public news , the theater , and scandal .
&quot; You say _ perhaps _ , &quot; Serpuhovskoy went on , as though guessing his thoughts , &quot; but I say _ for certain _ .
Evidently she had hit on other absurd and grotesque aspects in her husband and was awaiting the moment to give expression to them .
&quot; Why be in such a hurry ?
Levin got off his mare , and fastening her up by the roadside went to meet Tit , who took a second scythe out of a bush and gave it to him .
In these words of Agafea Mihalovna , Levin read the final act of the drama which had been enacted of late between her and Kitty .
His ambitious plans had retreated into the background again , and feeling that he had got out of that circle of activity in which everything was definite , he had given himself entirely to his passion , and that passion was binding him more and more closely to her .
Shtcherbatsky told me another story - he met you - that you were in such a depressed state , talking of nothing but death .... &quot; &quot; Well , what of it ?
&quot; Your praise is worth having .
I &apos;m going away , I &apos;m going away . &quot; She had reached the door , when she heard his step .
Don &apos;t say that ! &quot; answered Anna &apos;s excited voice .
&quot; Well , I &apos;m very glad , &quot; said Sviazhsky .
He felt no weariness ; all he wanted was to get his work done more and more quickly and as much done as possible .
&quot; Well , and what have you to say to me ? &quot; said Levin in a quivering voice , feeling that all the muscles of his face were quivering too .
&quot; Yes , there &apos;s a wonderful mastery ! &quot; said Vronsky .
Instead of a lively , healthy visitor , some outsider who would , he hoped , cheer him up in his uncertain humor , he had to see his brother , who knew him through and through , who would call forth all the thoughts nearest his heart , would force him to show himself fully .
&quot; Since dinner time they &apos;ve carried a good half of it . &quot; &quot; The last load , eh ? &quot; he shouted to a young peasant , who drove by , standing in the front of an empty cart , shaking the cord reins .
But though Vronsky had not the least suspicion what the parents were saying , he felt on coming away from the Shtcherbatskys &quot; that the secret spiritual bond which existed between him and Kitty had grown so much stronger that evening that some step must be taken .
But now , without an instant &apos;s consideration , he declined it , and observing dissatisfaction in the most exalted quarters at this step , he immediately retired from the army .
&quot; She is in my album , &quot; she said ; &quot; and , by the way , I &apos;ll show you my Seryozha , &quot; she added , with a mother &apos;s smile of pride .
No , that &apos;s too lovely ! &quot; &quot; I wonder that with her sense - for she &apos;s not a fool , you know - that she doesn &apos;t see how funny she is . &quot; Everyone had something to say in censure or ridicule of the luckless Madame Maltishtcheva , and the conversation crackled merrily , like a burning faggot @-@ stack .
But not only those ladies , almost everyone in the room , even the Princess Myakaya and Betsy herself , looked several times in the direction of the two who had withdrawn from the general circle , as though that were a disturbing fact .
It was only after driving nearly five miles that he had sufficiently recovered himself to look at his watch , and realize that it was half @-@ past five , and he was late .
They agreed that the modern plough ploughed better , that the scarifier did the work more quickly , but they found thousands of reasons that made it out of the question for them to use either of them ; and though he had accepted the conviction that he would have to lower the standard of cultivation , he felt sorry to give up improved methods , the advantages of which were so obvious .
She was contented and happy in her children ; I never interfered with her in anything ; I let her manage the children and the house just as she liked .
&quot; How do you mean ?
Levin saw she was unhappy and tried to comfort her , saying that it showed nothing bad , that all children fight ; but , even as he said it , he was thinking in his heart : &quot; No , I won &apos;t be artificial and talk French with my children ; but my children won &apos;t be like that .
You know we have sometimes laughed at him for putting in at every word : &quot; Dolly &apos;s a marvelous woman . &quot; You have always been a divinity for him , and you are that still , and this has not been an infidelity of the heart .... &quot; &quot; But if it is repeated ? &quot; &quot; It cannot be , as I understand it .... &quot; &quot; Yes , but could you forgive it ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , I can &apos;t judge ....
&quot; Very much .
How am I to set about it ? &quot; he asked himself again , and could not find an answer .
Our laborer can do nothing but get drunk like a pig , and when he &apos;s drunk he ruins everything you give him .
He felt that he had penetrated more deeply than ever before into this intricate affair , and that he had originated a leading idea - he could say it without self @-@ flattery - calculated to clear up the whole business , to strengthen him in his official career , to discomfit his enemies , and thereby to be of the greatest benefit to the government .
They showed them to us . &quot; &quot; Why , have you been at the Schützburgs ? &quot; asked the hostess from the samovar .
She used to stay in the country as a child , and the impression she had retained of it was that the country was a refuge from all the unpleasantness of the town , that life there , though not luxurious - Dolly could easily make up her mind to that - was cheap and comfortable ; that there was plenty of everything , everything was cheap , everything could be got , and children were happy .
Think it over thoroughly .
Chapter 13 Mihailov sold Vronsky his picture , and agreed to paint a portrait of Anna .
&quot; How fine ! &quot; said Golenishtchev , he too , with unmistakable sincerity , falling under the spell of the picture .
She was dreaming with delight now of Dolly &apos;s coming to them with her children , especially because she would order for the children their favorite puddings and Dolly would appreciate all her new housekeeping .
Only one he did not see , his chief rival , Mahotin on Gladiator .
&quot; Yes , it &apos;s all very well , &quot; said the colonel to Vronsky , whom he had invited to come and see him .
I was married , and my husband deceived me ; in anger and jealousy , I would have thrown up everything , I would myself ....
&quot; Well , then , my friend , you give us two - or better say three - dozen oysters , clear soup with vegetables .... &quot; &quot; _ Printanière , _ &quot; prompted the Tatar .
He wanted to weep over his dying , dearly loved brother , and he had to listen and keep on talking of how he meant to live .
What are you to do ?
It will be of far wider scope , and will touch on almost all questions .
He sat through two acts there , and saw everyone he had wanted to see .
Reckoning up his money and his bank book , he found that he had left one thousand eight hundred roubles , and nothing coming in before the New Year .
That was so far well , but Vronsky knew that in this dirty business , though his only share in it was undertaking by word of mouth to be surety for Venovsky , it was absolutely necessary for him to have the two thousand five hundred roubles so as to be able to fling it at the swindler , and have no more words with him .
It was flying straight towards him ; the guttural cry , like the even tearing of some strong stuff , sounded close to his ear ; the long beak and neck of the bird could be seen , and at the very instant when Levin was taking aim , behind the bush where Oblonsky stood , there was a flash of red lightning : the bird dropped like an arrow , and darted upwards again .
Levin felt envious of this health and mirthfulness ; he longed to take part in the expression of this joy of life .
When she got her husband &apos;s letter , she knew then at the bottom of her heart that everything would go on in the old way , that she would not have the strength of will to forego her position , to abandon her son , and to join her lover .
He glanced at the sky , expecting to find there the cloud shell he had been admiring and taking as the symbol of the ideas and feelings of that night .
And in this position he took an important resolution .
&quot; I know nothing of her except the very best , and I have seen nothing but kindness and affection from her towards myself . &quot; It was true that as far as she could recall her impressions at Petersburg at the Karenins , &quot; she did not like their household itself ; there was something artificial in the whole framework of their family life .
And in spite of this he felt that then , when his love was stronger , he could , if he had greatly wished it , have torn that love out of his heart ; but now , when as at that moment it seemed to him he felt no love for her , he knew that what bound him to her could not be broken .
Your _ lessive _ lasted a good time today , &quot; said Petritsky .
What he particularly disliked was that Golenishtchev , a man belonging to a good set , should put himself on a level with some scribbling fellows , with whom he was irritated and angry .
They compose an ardent epistle , a declaration in fact , and they carry the letter upstairs themselves , so as to elucidate whatever might appear not perfectly intelligible in the letter . &quot; &quot; Why are you telling me these horrible stories ?
This child &apos;s presence called up both in Vronsky and in Anna a feeling akin to the feeling of a sailor who sees by the compass that the direction in which he is swiftly moving is far from the right one , but that to arrest his motion is not in his power , that every instant is carrying him further and further away , and that to admit to himself his deviation from the right direction is the same as admitting his certain ruin .
And to her surprise Dolly saw that Anna was blushing up to her ears , up to the curly black ringlets on her neck .
&quot; But I repeat , it &apos;s an accomplished fact .
&quot; No , don &apos;t go away , please don &apos;t , &quot; pleaded Liza Merkalova , hearing that Anna was going .
I wanted to be for the tenth time , but the post was taken , &quot; said Count Siniavin to the pretty Princess Tcharskaya , who had designs on him .
&quot; Better not go in , &quot; he added , touching his hat .
She had a strange religion of transmigration of souls all her own , in which she had firm faith , troubling herself little about the dogmas of the Church .
They were turning the plough over .
On her head there was such a superstructure of soft , golden hair - her own and false mixed - that her head was equal in size to the elegantly rounded bust , of which so much was exposed in front .
He walked about the whole day and only brought back three birds , but to make up for that - he brought back , as he always did from shooting , an excellent appetite , excellent spirits , and that keen , intellectual mood which with him always accompanied violent physical exertion .
She did not understand either that Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s peculiar loquacity that day , so exasperating to her , was merely the expression of his inward distress and uneasiness .
His despair was even intensified by the consciousness that he was utterly alone in his sorrow .
This meant the defeat of Alexey Alexandrovitch .
He glanced at the sky in the interval for whetting the scythes .
It grew stronger , rested for an instant , and slowly died away .
Tell me the truth , &quot; said Darya Alexandrovna , taking her by the hand : &quot; tell me , did Levin speak to you ? ... &quot; The mention of Levin &apos;s name seemed to deprive Kitty of the last vestige of self @-@ control .
The whole system of culture , the chief element in the condition of the people , must be completely transformed .
Easter came in the snow .
&quot; Later ! &quot; Chapter 21 The temporary stable , a wooden shed , had been put up close to the race course , and there his mare was to have been taken the previous day .
It seemed to her that both she and all of them were insincere , and she felt so bored and ill at ease in that world that she went to see the Countess Lidia Ivanovna as little as possible .
&quot; Most delighted , &quot; he said , and asked after his wife and sister @-@ in @-@ law .
Why is it you have never married ? &quot; Sergey Ivanovitch smiled .
Vronsky said something silly , which it was easy to put a stop to , and I answered as I ought to have done .
She was horrified at her paleness , as she glanced into the looking @-@ glass .
I &apos;ve had to do with all of them ; I know them .
&quot; Luckless child ! &quot; said the nurse , hushing the baby , and still walking up and down with it .
He stopped halfway at a well @-@ to @-@ do peasant &apos;s to feed his horses .
That day he was continually blowing his nose , and groaning piteously .
Vronsky was aware of his comrades &quot; view of him , and in addition to his liking for the life , he felt bound to keep up that reputation .
At the end of August he heard that the Oblonskys had gone away to Moscow , from their servant who brought back the side @-@ saddle .
He consulted the old prince , and with his sanction gave Kitty his diary , in which there was written the confession that tortured him .
&quot; It was not , perhaps , of importance in the days of serfdom , and it may not be of importance in England .
I see you &apos;re unhappy .... &quot; But Kitty in her fury did not hear her .
&quot; The one thing to be dreaded is meeting Russians abroad .
Chapter 9 At four o &apos;clock , conscious of his throbbing heart , Levin stepped out of a hired sledge at the Zoological Gardens , and turned along the path to the frozen mounds and the skating ground , knowing that he would certainly find her there , as he had seen the Shtcherbatskys &quot; carriage at the entrance .
What a wonder ! &quot; she said , letting fall her hood , and without stopping , she went on into the dressing @-@ room .
&quot; I am very , very grateful to you , both for your deeds and for your words , &quot; he said , when she had finished praying .
He threw open his coat , but afterwards did take it off , and sat on for a whole hour , talking to Levin about hunting and the most intimate subjects .
Kitty found all this out not from words .
Just look at her in the puce dress - an ambassador &apos;s wife they say she is - how her skirt bounces out from side to side ! &quot; &quot; What a pretty dear the bride is - like a lamb decked with flowers !
He believed that for Anna herself it would be better to break off all relations with Vronsky ; but if they all thought this out of the question , he was even ready to allow these relations to be renewed , so long as the children were not disgraced , and he was not deprived of them nor forced to change his position .
It &apos;s just as you mustn &apos;t be afraid of not being able to fall asleep , if you &apos;re afraid of sleeplessness .
&quot; Look at Sviazhsky &apos;s , for instance .
His feeling infected her .
Don &apos;t I know perfectly well that my friends would never allow me to fight a duel - would never allow the life of a statesman , needed by Russia , to be exposed to danger ?
Our life has been joined , not by man , but by God .
It &apos;s very well to be original and genuine , and to dislike everything conventional - I know all about that ; but really , what you &apos;re saying either has no meaning , or it has a very wrong meaning .
&quot; You gave my assistant two hundred roubles .
&quot; I cannot admit it , &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch , with his habitual clearness , precision of expression , and elegance of phrase .
During all this difficult time Alexey Alexandrovitch had noticed that his worldly acquaintances , especially women , took a peculiar interest in him and his wife .
&quot; Vronsky ? &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , checking his yawn ; &quot; he &apos;s in Petersburg .
While they were still engaged , he had been struck by the definiteness with which she had declined the tour abroad and decided to go into the country , as though she knew of something she wanted , and could still think of something outside her love .
Think a little .
And that irritated Levin .
And they don &apos;t turn up .
Yesterday Pravdin wrote to me .... &quot; Pravdin was a well @-@ known Panslavist abroad , and Countess Lidia Ivanovna described the purport of his letter .
&quot; He will be your support and your succor . &quot; Although there was in these words a flavor of that sentimental emotion at her own lofty feelings , and that new mystical fervor which had lately gained ground in Petersburg , and which seemed to Alexey Alexandrovitch disproportionate , still it was pleasant to him to hear this now .
The barber had gone .
I got a note from Stiva that you were here . &quot; &quot; From Stiva ? &quot; Darya Alexandrovna asked with surprise .
But whether I am right or wrong , that pride you so despise makes any thought of Katerina Alexandrovna out of the question for me , - you understand , utterly out of the question . &quot; &quot; I will only say one thing more : you know that I am speaking of my sister , whom I love as I love my own children .
Vronsky and all his comrades knew Kuzovlev and his peculiarity of &quot; weak nerves &quot; and terrible vanity .
The trap was already at the steps when they went out .
&quot; But I &apos;ll try .
You will have to forgive me so much .
But the race began not in the ring , but two hundred yards away from it , and in that part of the course was the first obstacle , a dammed @-@ up stream , seven feet in breadth , which the racers could leap or wade through as they preferred .
He felt as though the sun were coming near him .
Amazed and intimidated , she gazed at him in silence .
Maybe God will aid you .
That &apos;s a good expression , &quot; _ come round , _ &quot; &quot; he thought .
The transition from that past to a knowledge of his wife &apos;s unfaithfulness he had lived through miserably already ; that state was painful , but he could understand it .
An inveterate supporter of serfdom at heart , like all of them ! &quot; said Sviazhsky .
But I fancy .... &quot; All Mihailov &apos;s mobile face beamed at once ; his eyes sparkled .
Tit sharpened his scythe and Levin &apos;s , and they went on .
During the prince &apos;s outburst she was silent ; she felt ashamed for her mother , and tender towards her father for so quickly being kind again .
Ivan directed her how to fasten the cord to the cross @-@ piece , and at something she said he laughed aloud .
&quot; Most likely they &apos;ve already looked at all the antiques , and now they &apos;re making the round of the studios of the new people , the German humbug , and the cracked Pre @-@ Raphaelite English fellow , and have only come to me to make the point of view complete , &quot; he thought .
Pointing Levin with her bare arm to the door into the parlor , she bent down again , hiding her handsome face , and went on scrubbing .
It &apos;s as though .... &quot; He talked on , addressing both Kitty and Levin , turning his serene , friendly eyes from one to the other , and saying obviously just what came into his head .
To all inquiries made him as to how he felt , he made the same answer with an expression of vindictive reproachfulness , &quot; I &apos;m suffering horribly , intolerably ! &quot; The sick man was suffering more and more , especially from bedsores , which it was impossible now to remedy , and grew more and more angry with everyone about him , blaming them for everything , and especially for not having brought him a doctor from Moscow .
&quot; What are you wanting ? &quot; He replied that he had to see the lawyer on some business .
The dying man lay with closed eyes , but the muscles twitched from time to time on his forehead , as with one thinking deeply and intensely .
On the hatstand there was a military overcoat .
The doctor &apos;s prediction was fulfilled .
If you want him defined , here he is : a prime , well @-@ fed beast such as takes medals at the cattle shows , and nothing more , &quot; he said , with a tone of vexation that interested her .
She saw him the very instant he walked into the room .
&quot; You &apos;ve got a shirt on , &quot; Kouzma answered , with a placid smile .
clear up the room , &quot; the sick man said with effort .
&quot; I &apos;ll send to him and find out , and let you know , &quot; Betsy whispered to her .
He was loath to leave his brother alone all day long , and he was afraid his brother would laugh at him about it .
She was not alone ; all around was that luxurious setting of idleness that she was used to , and she felt less wretched than at home .
&quot; We &apos;ll talk it over , then .
A string of carts was moving across it .
But good judges have said the same . &quot; Chapter 8 Anna , in that first period of her emancipation and rapid return to health , felt herself unpardonably happy and full of the joy of life .
At the very moment of starting Stepan Arkadyevitch arrived , late , rosy and good @-@ humored , smelling of wine and cigars .
&quot; And if it is true ? &quot; he said to himself .
&quot; I &apos;ll come some day , &quot; he said .
Tell me frankly now , &quot; he pursued , picking up a cigar and keeping one hand on his glass ; &quot; give me your advice . &quot; &quot; Why , what is it ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you .
He found her in one of the back rooms .
And _ he _ was there .
There was nothing either exceptional or strange in a man &apos;s calling at half @-@ past nine on a friend to inquire details of a proposed dinner party and not coming in , but it seemed strange to all of them .
&quot; You are distressed , I understand that .
&quot; &quot; It &apos;s never too late to mend . &quot; &quot; The attaché repeated the English proverb .
&quot; That is not for us to judge , &quot; said Madame Stahl , perceiving the shade of expression on the prince &apos;s face .
Two officers appeared at the entrance @-@ door : one , a young fellow , with a feeble , delicate face , who had lately joined the regiment from the Corps of Pages ; the other , a plump , elderly officer , with a bracelet on his wrist , and little eyes , lost in fat .
&quot; Very , very miserably .
&quot; I &apos;m not interrupting you ? &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , on the sight of his brother @-@ in @-@ law becoming suddenly aware of a sense of embarrassment unusual with him .
It is true that when they were both in a good temper their enjoyment of life was redoubled .
And for the first time , for an instant , she felt for him , put herself in his place , and was sorry for him .
I am fond of good things . &quot; &quot; I should hope so !
What are you saying ? &quot; cried Oblonsky , and his suffering was apparent in his face .
&quot; Coming immediately , &quot; said the clerk ; and two minutes later there did actually appear in the doorway the large figure of an old solicitor who had been consulting with the lawyer himself .
&quot; Come ; there &apos;s not such a crowd now , &quot; said Vronsky .
All the fuss of the shirt , of being late , all the talk of friends and relations , their annoyance , his ludicrous position - all suddenly passed away and he was filled with joy and dread .
Her eyes were , it seemed , opened ; she felt all the difficulty of maintaining herself without hypocrisy and self @-@ conceit on the pinnacle to which she had wished to mount .
I &apos;ve never been a communist . &quot; &quot; But I have , and I consider it &apos;s premature , but rational , and it has a future , just like Christianity in its first ages . &quot; &quot; All that I maintain is that the labor force ought to be investigated from the point of view of natural science ; that is to say , it ought to be studied , its qualities ascertained .... &quot; &quot; But that &apos;s utter waste of time .
He has not come yet .
She thought of them on the one day of their triumph , when they had stood like Kitty under the wedding crown , with love and hope and dread in their hearts , renouncing the past , and stepping forward into the mysterious future .
I only ask you to give me _ carte blanche _ .
He maintained that the poverty of Russia arises not merely from the anomalous distribution of landed property and misdirected reforms , but that what had contributed of late years to this result was the civilization from without abnormally grafted upon Russia , especially facilities of communication , as railways , leading to centralization in towns , the development of luxury , and the consequent development of manufactures , credit and its accompaniment of speculation - all to the detriment of agriculture .
Altogether there were a great many most complicated matters to be considered and arranged .
time &apos;s up already , &quot; And he went to the door .
She was fascinating in her simple black dress , fascinating were her round arms with their bracelets , fascinating was her firm neck with its thread of pearls , fascinating the straying curls of her loose hair , fascinating the graceful , light movements of her little feet and hands , fascinating was that lovely face in its eagerness , but there was something terrible and cruel in her fascination .
And suddenly , without doing so , he disappeared .
The Englishman looked gravely at him ; and , as though he , too , knew where Vronsky was going , he added : &quot; The great thing &apos;s to keep quiet before a race , &quot; said he ; &quot; don &apos;t get out of temper or upset about anything . &quot; &quot; All right , &quot; answered Vronsky , smiling ; and jumping into his carriage , he told the man to drive to Peterhof .
the cuckoo already ! &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , coming out from behind a bush .
&quot; Very well !
And Anna soon felt this .
Kitty made a low and graceful curtsey in the _ very simple _ , that is to say , very elegant frock that had been ordered her from Paris .
And simply from the look in her eyes , that grew unconsciously brighter , Levin knew that she loved that man , knew it as surely as if she had told him so in words .
But I will set to work .
Don &apos;t be surprised at me .
&quot; Allow me to see you home , &quot; said the colonel .
That body , robbed by him of life , was their love , the first stage of their love .
&quot; Well , master , when summer &apos;s here , mind you don &apos;t scold me for these rows , &quot; said Vassily .
&quot; I have heard all !
&quot; You &apos;re about , I hear , to marry the daughter of my parishioner and son in the spirit , Prince Shtcherbatsky ? &quot; he resumed , with a smile .
I should still just as much have to decide what I ought to do with her .
&quot; So you &apos;ll come ? &quot; &quot; Of course . &quot; &quot; At five o &apos;clock , then , and not evening dress . &quot; And Stepan Arkadyevitch got up and went down below to the new head of his department .
&quot; If you admit that it is a benefit , &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch , &quot; then , as an honest man , you cannot help caring about it and sympathizing with the movement , and so wishing to work for it . &quot; &quot; But I still do not admit this movement to be just , &quot; said Konstantin Levin , reddening a little .
During the consultation with the secretary Levin had completely recovered from his embarrassment .
She was glad to see him at any time , but at this moment she was specially glad he should see her in all her glory .
Low as was his opinion of Golenishtchev &apos;s capacity for understanding art , trifling as was the true remark upon the fidelity of the expression of Pilate as an official , and offensive as might have seemed the utterance of so unimportant an observation while nothing was said of more serious points , Mihailov was in an ecstasy of delight at this observation .
Something was by her directions brought into the sick @-@ room , something else was carried out .
She knew that the support of religion was possible only upon condition of renouncing what made up for her the whole meaning of life .
Only after Mihailov &apos;s portrait was painted he left off painting his portrait of Anna , deciding that it was now not needed .
&quot; I cared for him , and he cared for me ; but his mother did not wish it , and he married another girl .
It seems to me that he &apos;s happy too .
&quot; It would be nicer for him and for us too . &quot; The old prince got up and stroked Kitty &apos;s hair .
And take note : if there is an early stage of tuberculous process , of which we cannot be certain , a foreign tour will be of no use .
&quot; Not just now , &quot; said she .
&quot; Love those that hate you .... &quot; Darya Alexandrovna whispered timorously .
I &apos;ve been in love , but it &apos;s not that .
Carried to an extreme , the measures seemed at once to be so absurd that the highest authorities , and public opinion , and intellectual ladies , and the newspapers , all at the same time fell foul of them , expressing their indignation both with the measures and their nominal father , Alexey Alexandrovitch .
He was offended for the first instant , but the very same second he felt that he could not be offended by her , that she was himself .
Chapter 20 Vronsky &apos;s life was particularly happy in that he had a code of principles , which defined with unfailing certitude what he ought and what he ought not to do .
Chapter 5 &quot; This is rather indiscreet , but it &apos;s so good it &apos;s an awful temptation to tell the story , &quot; said Vronsky , looking at her with his laughing eyes .
&quot; Yes , &quot; she went on , &quot; become your mistress , and complete the ruin of .... &quot; Again she would have said &quot; my son , &quot; but she could not utter that word .
One of the two had to be a fool .
After talking a little of her old governess and her peculiarities , she questioned him about his life .
If Levin had felt happy before in the cattle pens and farmyard , he felt happier yet in the open country .
She repeated continually , &quot; My God !
&quot; You ought to like her .
He was incapable of deceiving himself and persuading himself that he repented of his conduct .
&quot; But you &apos;ll come back here after the races , I suppose ? &quot; &quot; Oh , yes ! &quot; answered Alexey Alexandrovitch .
He would go into the nursery several times a day , and sit there for a long while , so that the nurses , who were at first afraid of him , got quite used to his presence .
He knew that this was Gladiator , but , with the feeling of a man turning away from the sight of another man &apos;s open letter , he turned round and went into Frou @-@ Frou &apos;s stall .
And the idea that he might be led on by his interests , that he might seek a reconciliation with his wife on account of the sale of the forest - that idea hurt him .
But general propositions as to feeding on meal and on grass were doubtful and obscure .
&quot; In a steeplechase it all depends on riding and on pluck , &quot; said the Englishman .
At the entrance of the garden they met the blind lady , Madame Berthe , with her guide , and the prince was delighted to see the old Frenchwoman &apos;s face light up when she heard Kitty &apos;s voice .
&quot; But I &apos;ll say more : my wife is a wonderful woman .... &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed , remembering his position with his wife , and , after a moment &apos;s silence , resumed - &quot; She has a gift of foreseeing things .
&quot; I am afraid she does not understand her own position .
She was a thin , sallow , sickly , and nervous woman , with brilliant black eyes .
In Turkey he had got into a harem ; in India he had hunted on an elephant , and now in Russia he wished to taste all the specially Russian forms of pleasure .
&quot; Well , _ au revoir _ , &quot; she said to Vronsky .
So you had a nice day too ?
It was only in the third month of their married life , after their return from Moscow , where they had been staying for a month , that their life began to go more smoothly .
We &apos;ll ask Koznishev and Pestsov , so as to entertain him with our Moscow celebrities . &quot; &quot; Yes , please , do come , &quot; said Dolly ; &quot; we will expect you at five , or six o &apos;clock , if you like .
To write that he would go was impossible , because he could not go ; to write that he could not come because something prevented him , or that he would be away , that was still worse .
Mihailov meanwhile , although Anna &apos;s portrait greatly fascinated him , was even more glad than they were when the sittings were over , and he had no longer to listen to Golenishtchev &apos;s disquisitions upon art , and could forget about Vronsky &apos;s painting .
He bowed , and was meaning to retreat .
He read another article , too , a financial one , which alluded to Bentham and Mill , and dropped some innuendoes reflecting on the ministry .
Do you think so ?
It was all horribly disgusting , yet to Levin it appeared not at all in the same disgusting light as it inevitably would to those who did not know Nikolay , did not know all his story , did not know his heart .
And such men are more needed than ever . &quot; Vronsky listened attentively , but he was not so much interested by the meaning of the words as by the attitude of Serpuhovskoy who was already contemplating a struggle with the existing powers , and already had his likes and dislikes in that higher world , while his own interest in the governing world did not go beyond the interests of his regiment .
&quot; I should not be a lawyer if I could not keep the secrets confided to me .
The inspection of objects of interest , apart from the fact that everything had been seen already , had not for Vronsky , a Russian and a sensible man , the immense significance Englishmen are able to attach to that pursuit .
There ! &quot; said Vronsky , going up to the mare and speaking soothingly to her .
It went of itself , like all such boards , by the mere force of inertia .
&quot; I don &apos;t suppose so , &quot; said Serpuhovskoy , smiling again .
He tried not to look at her , but unconsciously his eyes were drawn to her .
Yes , it &apos;s an aim worth working for .
&quot; Why didn &apos;t you come to dinner ? &quot; she said to him .
But to drag that _ fardeau _ about with you without marriage , your hands will always be so full that you can do nothing .
Immediately afterwards a footman came from Princess Betsy and brought Anna a note .
All that was painful in his relations with Anna , all the feeling of indefiniteness left by their conversation , had slipped out of his mind .
He understands nothing , and feels nothing .
Tit moved on with sweep after sweep of his scythe , not stopping nor showing signs of weariness .
Ask anyone !
He would not forget .
I often think that you have ruined your whole life for me . &quot; &quot; I was just thinking the very same thing , &quot; he said ; &quot; how could you sacrifice everything for my sake ?
Vronsky was aware of those eyes fastened upon him from all sides , but he saw nothing except the ears and neck of his own mare , the ground racing to meet him , and the back and white legs of Gladiator beating time swiftly before him , and keeping always the same distance ahead .
I &apos;m not queer , but I &apos;m nasty .
But his cherished scheme only engrossed him the more .
&quot; Well , we crumble it up , &quot; answered Vassily , taking up some seed and rolling the earth in his palms .
&quot; Well , what do you say ?
&quot; Everything is before you . &quot; &quot; Why , is it over for you already ? &quot; &quot; No ; not over exactly , but the future is yours , and the present is mine , and the present - well , it &apos;s not all that it might be . &quot; &quot; How so ? &quot; &quot; Oh , things go wrong .
Here you &apos;ve come round to my point .
But now this letter seemed to her more awful than anything she had been able to conceive .
And as soon as her brother had reached her , with a gesture that struck Vronsky by its decision and its grace , she flung her left arm around his neck , drew him rapidly to her , and kissed him warmly .
To forget himself in sleep was impossible now , at least till nighttime ; he could not go back now to the music sung by the decanter @-@ women ; so he must forget himself in the dream of daily life .
Petrov got up , leaning on his stick , and looked shyly at the prince .
Even my ordinary pursuits I have almost given up .
One of the younger women kept staring at the Englishwoman , who was dressing after all the rest , and when she put on her third petticoat she could not refrain from the remark , &quot; My , she keeps putting on and putting on , and she &apos;ll never have done ! &quot; she said , and they all went off into roars .
Before you take advice , see my wife , talk to her .
You know , one of those uncouth new people one &apos;s so often coming across nowadays , one of those free @-@ thinkers you know , who are reared _ d &apos;emblée _ in theories of atheism , scepticism , and materialism .
For God &apos;s sake , talk to her !
The calf , fumbling , poked her nose under her mother &apos;s udder , and stiffened her tail out straight .
He looked a long , tender look at her .
&quot; Matvey says she will come round ; but how ?
The simple @-@ hearted Marya Yevgenyevna simply roared with laughter at everything absurd the prince said , and his jokes made Varenka helpless with feeble but infectious laughter , which was something Kitty had never seen before .
&quot; Marriages aren &apos;t made nowadays as they used to be , &quot; was thought and said by all these young girls , and even by their elders .
Rare indeed were the brief periods of peace .
Liza Merkalova &apos;s husband carries her shawl , and is always ready to be of use .
The second installment for the forest had been received from the merchant and was not yet exhausted ; Dolly had been very amiable and good @-@ humored of late , and the idea of the dinner pleased Stepan Arkadyevitch from every point of view .
But at the very moment she was uttering the words , she felt that they were not true .
Catching the sound of footsteps coming from the other side of the entry towards the staircase , the head waiter turned round , and seeing the Russian count , who had taken their best rooms , he took his hands out of his pockets deferentially , and with a bow informed him that a courier had been , and that the business about the palazzo had been arranged .
Do you remember last time at Hapilovo ?
I have taken a great fancy to your daughter . &quot; &quot; You are still in weak health ? &quot; &quot; Yes ; I &apos;m used to it , &quot; said Madame Stahl , and she introduced the prince to the Swedish count .
Quickly indeed , as quickly as possible , she must take action before he was taken from her .
&quot; You can &apos;t get across the streams , Konstantin Dmitrievitch , &quot; the coachman shouted .
If there is , forgive him ! &quot; &quot; No , &quot; Dolly was beginning , but Anna cut her short , kissing her hand once more .
So terrible to him was what he knew that now he was ready to believe anything .
And he experienced the strange feeling that had sometimes come upon him since his secret love for Anna .
The old man did this easily .
&quot; Why , you &apos;ll see in the summer time .
They &apos;re not merchants , you know : they &apos;re speculators .
His awkwardness infected the pretty sister @-@ in @-@ law too .
As a fact , the boy did feel that he could not understand this relation , and he tried painfully , and was not able to make clear to himself what feeling he ought to have for this man .
The previous year - which was the third year - the peasants had maintained the same opposition to the arrangement , and the hay had been cut on the same system .
The schools are no good to me , but positively harmful , as I told you .
&quot; Ah , generosity ! &quot; said Nikolay , and he smiled .
Resolving on this , he promptly wrote a note to Rolandak , who had more than once sent to him with offers to buy horses from him .
&quot; It was a weakness , which would have shattered what strength I have left . &quot; Next day Betsy herself came to him in the morning , and announced that she had heard through Oblonsky as a positive fact that Alexey Alexandrovitch had agreed to a divorce , and that therefore Vronsky could see Anna .
&quot; That is , that you make Him the man @-@ god , and not the God @-@ man .
Among the trees they were continually cutting with their scythes the so @-@ called &quot; birch mushrooms , &quot; swollen fat in the succulent grass .
They would be justified in repeating hypocritically civil speeches in the presence of the painter , and pitying him and laughing at him when they were alone again .
&quot; Enough , Nikolay Dmitrievitch ! &quot; said Marya Nikolaevna , stretching out her plump , bare arm towards the decanter .
&quot; What was it Stiva told you ? &quot; &quot; Stiva gossiped about it all .
Chapter 27 Anna was upstairs , standing before the looking @-@ glass , and , with Annushka &apos;s assistance , pinning the last ribbon on her gown when she heard carriage wheels crunching the gravel at the entrance .
Even the memories , the impressions , the thoughts of this body awakened in him now the same aversion as the body itself .
There was a creak of steps at the door .
She was bending down , talking to a general who had come up to her .
He &apos;s not a man , but a machine , and a spiteful machine when he &apos;s angry , &quot; she added , recalling Alexey Alexandrovitch as she spoke , with all the peculiarities of his figure and manner of speaking , and reckoning against him every defect she could find in him , softening nothing for the great wrong she herself was doing him .
At his sick wife &apos;s bedside he had for the first time in his life given way to that feeling of sympathetic suffering always roused in him by the sufferings of others , and hitherto looked on by him with shame as a harmful weakness .
&quot; I wouldn &apos;t be in a hurry if I were you , &quot; said Levin .
I see : a new phase . &quot; Levin suddenly blushed , not as grown men blush , slightly , without being themselves aware of it , but as boys blush , feeling that they are ridiculous through their shyness , and consequently ashamed of it and blushing still more , almost to the point of tears .
The simple @-@ hearted cowherd , Ivan , who , Levin fancied , understood the matter better than any of them , collecting together a gang of workers to help him , principally of his own family , became a partner in the cattle @-@ yard .
&quot; I &apos;ll tell you , then , &quot; he said with heat , &quot; I imagine the mainspring of all our actions is , after all , self @-@ interest .
&quot; He &apos;s perfectly satisfied . &quot; &quot; What are we all miserable for , when everything might be so happy ? &quot; &quot; Only not he .
why didn &apos;t I die ! &quot; And she broke into sobs .
&quot; It &apos;s that idiotic smile that &apos;s to blame for it all , &quot; thought Stepan Arkadyevitch .
With the open courts and everything done in style , nowadays there &apos;s no question of stealing .
Letting his head sink into his hands , he sat for a long while in that position , several times attempted to speak and stopped short .
&quot; What if she does not love me ?
In their conversation everything had been said ; it had been said that she loved him , and that she would tell her father and mother that he would come tomorrow morning .
&quot; Good @-@ day , Vassily , &quot; he said , walking into the corridor with his hat cocked on one side , and addressing a footman he knew ; &quot; why , you &apos;ve let your whiskers grow !
Even though it happened at times that after a conversation with him it seemed that nothing particularly delightful had happened , the next day , and the next , everyone was just as delighted at meeting him again .
He did not ask me the meaning of it all , but he wanted to ask , and I could not bear the look in his eyes .
But apart from that , a challenge to fight would be an act hardly honest on my side .
But if you direct us to apply to her excellency , would you graciously oblige us with her address ? &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch pondered , as it seemed to the clerk , and all at once , turning round , he sat down at the table .
He had heard that women often did care for ugly and ordinary men , but he did not believe it , for he judged by himself , and he could not himself have loved any but beautiful , mysterious , and exceptional women .
For God &apos;s sake ! ...
( &quot; That fool Tcharsky : she wanted , I know , to stop him , but didn &apos;t know how to . &quot; ) &quot; Yes , apart from her interest in the house ( that she has ) , apart from dress and _ broderie anglaise _ , she has no serious interests .
In the morning he had been working in his studio at his big picture .
Still she did not forget that Anna , her sister @-@ in @-@ law , was the wife of one of the most important personages in Petersburg , and was a Petersburg _ grande dame _ .
They heard a shrill whistle in the distance , and in the exact time , so well known to the sportsman , two seconds later - another , a third , and after the third whistle the hoarse , guttural cry could be heard .
&quot; Oh , don &apos;t you know it ?
I have driven away the fiend , &quot; she added .
&quot; No ; what &apos;s that for ?
I got your letter , and here I am . &quot; &quot; Yes , all my hopes are in you , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch .
That answer is : one must live in the needs of the day - that is , forget oneself .
&quot; I don &apos;t , I don &apos;t believe it ! &quot; Dolly said , trying to catch his glance that avoided her .
Chapter 12 The load was tied on .
&quot; Lord , have pity on us ; Lord , have pity on us ; Lord , have pity on us ! &quot; she repeated to herself , till she fell asleep .
&quot; She &apos;s never thought of being married , and isn &apos;t thinking of it ; but she &apos;s very ill , and the doctors have sent her abroad .
&quot; &quot; I warned you of the results in the religious , the civil , and the domestic relation .
&quot; How is it you don &apos;t see ?
&quot; Well , let &apos;s talk , if it &apos;s so necessary .
&quot; I &apos;m not late ? &quot; &quot; You can never help being late ! &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , taking his arm .
&quot; Yes , &quot; he said , going up to her resolutely .
The princess , hearing that Varenka had a good voice , asked her to come and sing to them in the evening .
Well , the young men go in to their comrade &apos;s ; he was giving a farewell dinner .
Levin knew that this passionate prayer and hope would only make him feel more bitterly parting from the life he so loved .
You and I are one to me .
&quot; But you , Konstantin Dmitrievitch , do you believe in it ? &quot; she asked Levin .
It was a splendid set of four horses with bells , and in a second you flashed by , and I saw you at the window - you were sitting like this , holding the strings of your cap in both hands , and thinking awfully deeply about something , &quot; he said , smiling .
Here &apos;s the garden of the Vrede Villa .
Suddenly , in the midst of his toil , without understanding what it was or whence it came , he felt a pleasant sensation of chill on his hot , moist shoulders .
&quot; Yes , yes ! &quot; answered Levin , without an idea of what they were talking about .
What the laborer wanted was to work as pleasantly as possible , with rests , and above all , carelessly and heedlessly , without thinking .
There is nothing else for me to do . &quot; &quot; Nothing else to do , nothing else to do .... &quot; she replied , with tears in her eyes .
Why , I &apos;m buying it , upon my honor , simply , believe me , for the glory of it , that Ryabinin , and no one else , should have bought the copse of Oblonsky .
&quot; Of course it is .
He pointed to some sort of iron bars , fastened together with strings , lying in a corner of the room .
I &apos;ll go home . &quot; He went straight to his room at Dussots &quot; Hotel , ordered supper , and then undressed , and as soon as his head touched the pillow , fell into a sound sleep .
If you have evening parties , invite everyone , don &apos;t pick out the possible suitors .
&quot; Well , Yegor , it &apos;s hard work not sleeping , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; One &apos;s got to put up with it !
Of all that had been said , what stuck most in his memory was the phrase of stupid , good @-@ natured Turovtsin - &quot; _ Acted like a man , he did !
He was always in a hurry to speak , and seemed always to put his whole soul into what he was saying .
Hence Vronsky had met him with the chilling and haughty manner he so well knew how to assume , the meaning of which was : &quot; You may like or dislike my way of life , that &apos;s a matter of the most perfect indifference to me ; you will have to treat me with respect if you want to know me . &quot; Golenishtchev had been contemptuously indifferent to the tone taken by Vronsky .
Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed , wiped his face , and with a subdued tread walked out of the room .
Alexey Alexandrovitch was walking about his room with his hands behind his back , thinking of just what Stepan Arkadyevitch had been discussing with his wife .
She was like a fine flower , already past its bloom and without fragrance , though the petals were still unwithered .
It &apos;s the truth I &apos;m telling you .
You love me ? &quot; She felt that the tears were coming into her eyes .
She was vexed , too , that from all she could learn of this connection it was not that brilliant , graceful , worldly _ liaison _ which she would have welcomed , but a sort of Wertherish , desperate passion , so she was told , which might well lead him into imprudence .
No , no , there are looks , there are ways ; I can &apos;t forget it , if I live a hundred years . &quot; &quot; Why so ?
&quot; Well , come in ; sit down .
If anyone had had the right to ask Alexey Alexandrovitch what he thought of his wife &apos;s behavior , the mild and peaceable Alexey Alexandrovitch would have made no answer , but he would have been greatly angered with any man who should question him on that subject .
And this long row seemed particularly hard work to Levin ; but when the end was reached and Tit , shouldering his scythe , began with deliberate stride returning on the tracks left by his heels in the cut grass , and Levin walked back in the same way over the space he had cut , in spite of the sweat that ran in streams over his face and fell in drops down his nose , and drenched his back as though he had been soaked in water , he felt very happy .
Kitty perceived that Anna knew what answer would follow .
Vronsky had never spoken to him of his passion , but he was aware that he knew all about it , and that he put the right interpretation on it , and he was glad to see that in his eyes .
&quot; She ought not to have worn a chignon , &quot; answered Madame Nikolaeva , who had long ago made up her mind that if the elderly widower she was angling for married her , the wedding should be of the simplest .
But how am I to forgive him , how am I to be his wife again after her ?
Well , Dolinka , &quot; he turned to his elder daughter , &quot; what &apos;s your young buck about , hey ? &quot; &quot; Nothing , father , &quot; answered Dolly , understanding that her husband was meant .
Vronsky and Madame Karenina must be , Mihailov supposed , distinguished and wealthy Russians , knowing nothing about art , like all those wealthy Russians , but posing as amateurs and connoisseurs .
&quot; You &apos;ve not seen me , but I &apos;ve seen you , &quot; said Levin , with a radiant smile of happiness .
The clumsy movement made by Vronsky had broken her back .
But he had not realized what an effect it would have on her , he had not put himself in her place .
The clerks and copyists all rose , greeting him with good @-@ humored deference .
&quot; I &apos;ve no liking for foreign tours .
&quot; Whatever was it I was disputing about ? &quot; he wondered .
Levin took the scythe , and began trying it .
Chapter 14 But at that very moment the princess came in .
Levin did not hear what the priest said .
The wind seemed as though lying in wait for her ; with gleeful whistle it tried to snatch her up and bear her off , but she clung to the cold door post , and holding her skirt got down onto the platform and under the shelter of the carriages .
So you would advise a knife to his throat ? &quot; &quot; To be sure , and manage that your hand may not be far from his lips .
&quot; What do you see in her out of the way ?
He pricked up his horse , and riding out from behind the acacias he saw a hired three @-@ horse sledge from the railway station , and a gentleman in a fur coat .
All this would have been very well , if there had been no exaggeration .
Before , when I was told to consider him clever , I kept looking for his ability , and thought myself a fool for not seeing it ; but directly I said , _ he &apos;s a fool , _ though only in a whisper , everything &apos;s explained , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; How spiteful you are today ! &quot; &quot; Not a bit .
But at this point Turovtsin broke suddenly and unexpectedly into the conversation , addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch .
He did not distinguish what sort of love his might be , big or little , passionate or passionless , lasting or passing ( he kept a ballet girl himself , though he was the father of a family , so he was lenient in these matters ) , but he knew that this love affair was viewed with displeasure by those whom it was necessary to please , and therefore he did not approve of his brother &apos;s conduct .
Alexey Alexandrovitch could not without horror contemplate the idea of a pistol aimed at himself , and had never made use of any weapon in his life .
No doubt , she could never regain his esteem , but there was not , and there could not be , any sort of reason that his existence should be troubled , and that he should suffer because she was a bad and faithless wife .
I respect your past and despise your present ... that I was far from the interpretation you put on my words . &quot; Anna sighed and bowed her head .
&quot; You have an extraordinary talent , &quot; the princess said to her after Varenka had sung the first song extremely well .
Though I do believe it &apos;s all right .
Anna got up and went to Betsy .
But you gain nothing .... &quot; &quot; Why do you mix things up ?
Kitty skates .
Spare me !
How I should like to know all her love story ! &quot; thought Kitty , recalling the unromantic appearance of Alexey Alexandrovitch , her husband .
But first I must write to them both . &quot; She went quickly indoors into her boudoir , sat down at the table , and wrote to her husband : - &quot; After what has happened , I cannot remain any longer in your house .
&quot; But I &apos;ll work it out better than that , &quot; he said to himself with a smile .
Our dear _ Samovar _ will be delighted . &quot; ( He used to call the Countess Lidia Ivanovna , well known in society , a samovar , because she was always bubbling over with excitement . )
But this step too presented the same drawback of public scandal as a divorce , and what was more , a separation , quite as much as a regular divorce , flung his wife into the arms of Vronsky .
The second race was apparently going on , for just as he went into the sheds he heard a bell ringing .
It &apos;s only those peoples that have an intuitive sense of what &apos;s of importance and significance in their institutions , and know how to value them , that have a future before them - it &apos;s only those peoples that one can truly call historical . &quot; And Sergey Ivanovitch carried the subject into the regions of philosophical history where Konstantin Levin could not follow him , and showed him all the incorrectness of his view .
I have heard all about it - your anxiety .
Since their conversation about religion when they were engaged neither of them had ever started a discussion of the subject , but she performed all the ceremonies of going to church , saying her prayers , and so on , always with the unvarying conviction that this ought to be so .
And she was not a girl who had gone the stale round of balls till every face in the ballroom was familiar and tiresome .
But at that instant they heard the princess &apos;s voice from the window .
I &apos;ve come to see you to talk it over . &quot; &quot; What is there to talk over ?
The greater number of the young women , who envied Anna and had long been weary of hearing her called _ virtuous _ , rejoiced at the fulfillment of their predictions , and were only waiting for a decisive turn in public opinion to fall upon her with all the weight of their scorn .
&quot; I &apos;m very , very ... plea ... Oh , what a fool I am .... &quot; He embraced Kitty , kissed her face , her hand , her face again , and made the sign of the cross over her .
&quot; Where &apos;s Cord ? &quot; he asked the stable @-@ boy .
He had sketched this new pose , when all at once he recalled the face of a shopkeeper of whom he had bought cigars , a vigorous face with a prominent chin , and he sketched this very face , this chin on to the figure of the man .
&quot; Idiotic woman ! &quot; he said to himself , sat down to the table , and , opening a portfolio , he set to work at once with peculiar fervor at a sketch he had begun .
That &apos;s where technique comes in . &quot; &quot; That will come , &quot; was the consoling reassurance given him by Golenishtchev , in whose view Vronsky had both talent , and what was most important , culture , giving him a wider outlook on art .
&quot; That only shows you have no heart , &quot; she said .
&quot; Why , you &apos;ve got the forest for nothing as it is , &quot; he said .
Well , is it possible for me to be present at the meeting ? &quot; &quot; Of course it is . &quot; &quot; What is your discussion about today ? &quot; asked Levin , never ceasing smiling .
&quot; You never thought I was to be your sister ? &quot; &quot; You would not have recognized me ? &quot; he said , with a radiant smile at her entrance .
She was utterly unlike what she had been when he first saw her .
&quot; Wait a minute , sit down . &quot; &quot; Please , please , don &apos;t let us talk of this , &quot; he said , sitting down , and at the same time feeling rise up and stir within his heart a hope he had believed to be buried .
I .... &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch , seeing Vronsky &apos;s tears , felt a rush of that nervous emotion always produced in him by the sight of other people &apos;s suffering , and turning away his face , he moved hurriedly to the door , without hearing the rest of his words .
A maid @-@ servant opens the door , they hand her the letter , and assure the maid that they &apos;re both so in love that they &apos;ll die on the spot at the door .
Levin was obliged to agree , and regaining his composure , and completely forgetting about Marya Nikolaevna by now , he went again in to his brother with Kitty .
&quot; Ah ! &quot; said Anna indifferently , as though not greatly interested in the matter , and she went on smiling : &quot; How can you or your friends compromise anyone ? &quot; This playing with words , this hiding of a secret , had a great fascination for Anna , as , indeed , it has for all women .
He wondered what Kitty was doing ; who lived in the next room ; whether the doctor lived in a house of his own .
&quot; No , give her to me ; give me my little one !
The old man crumbled up some bread in a cup , stirred it with the handle of a spoon , poured water on it from the dipper , broke up some more bread , and having seasoned it with salt , he turned to the east to say his prayer .
&quot; Yes , a sledge . &quot; On getting home , after three sleepless nights , Vronsky , without undressing , lay down flat on the sofa , clasping his hands and laying his head on them .
Can there be two opinions of the advantage of education ?
Each new feature only brought out the whole figure in all its force and vigor , as it had suddenly come to him from the spot of tallow .
Konstantin Levin regarded his brother as a man of immense intellect and culture , as generous in the highest sense of the word , and possessed of a special faculty for working for the public good .
It was apparent at the first glance .
In his own case , Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that a legal divorce , that is to say , one in which only the guilty wife would be repudiated , was impossible of attainment .
Be quiet , stupid , &quot; he conjured his heart .
This child &apos;s presence always and infallibly called up in Vronsky that strange feeling of inexplicable loathing which he had experienced of late .
Alexey Alexandrovitch had perceived this at once on entering office , and would have liked to lay hands on the Board of Irrigation .
While he was washing , Petritsky described to him in brief outlines his position , as far as it had changed since Vronsky had left Petersburg .
&quot; _ J &apos;ai forcé la consigne _ , &quot; she said , walking in with rapid steps and breathing hard with excitement and rapid exercise .
&quot; If I complain of anything it &apos;s only that I &apos;m not caught enough , to tell the truth .
In the corps Golenishtchev had belonged to the liberal party ; he left the corps without entering the army , and had never taken office under the government .
She put her arm around his head , moved towards him , and with defiant pride lifted up her eyes .
Finding instead of peace and rest all these , from her point of view , fearful calamities , Darya Alexandrovna was at first in despair .
&quot; What is it ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve been enjoying yourself , &quot; she began , trying to be calm and spiteful .
Wasn &apos;t it awful ? &quot; she said , looking at Anna with eyes that seemed to lay bare all her soul .
But if you think it over .... &quot; &quot; Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek , turn to him the other also ; and if any man take away thy coat , let him have thy cloak also , &quot; thought Alexey Alexandrovitch .
He could not say that he had cast off Marya Nikolaevna because the tea was weak , and , above all , because she would look after him , as though he were an invalid .
He suspected she had not told him everything .
I have been unhappy , and used to think one couldn &apos;t be more unhappy , but the awful state of things I am going through now , I could never have conceived .
&quot; I don &apos;t remember .
When he went out of his brother @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s room he was touched , but that did not prevent him from being glad he had successfully brought the matter to a conclusion , for he felt certain Alexey Alexandrovitch would not go back on his words .
But at that instant Konstantin Levin was not in a condition to feel all the gratification of making such an acquaintance .
&quot; Well , what a shame not to have let us know !
Do you like the white seal ? &quot; &quot; _ Cachet blanc , _ &quot; prompted the Tatar .
But Levin felt a longing to get as much mowing done that day as possible , and was vexed with the sun sinking so quickly in the sky .
Two other ladies began talking to Anna , and a stout elderly lady tucked up her feet , and made observations about the heating of the train .
Chapter 26 The external relations of Alexey Alexandrovitch and his wife had remained unchanged .
She asked him about the races .
If it &apos;s settled , it &apos;s useless haggling ; but if it &apos;s not , &quot; said Levin , &quot; I &apos;ll buy the forest . &quot; The smile vanished at once from Ryabinin &apos;s face .
tell me all . &quot; &quot; I am thinking you can &apos;t love me .
She was especially struck by the feeling of dissatisfaction with herself that she experienced on meeting him .
Chapter 4 The highest Petersburg society is essentially one : in it everyone knows everyone else , everyone even visits everyone else .
&quot; On Thursdays we are home , as always . &quot; &quot; Today , then ? &quot; &quot; We shall be pleased to see you , &quot; the princess said stiffly .
But she could not but agree with Levin that to fix it for after Lent would be putting it off too late , as an old aunt of Prince Shtcherbatsky &apos;s was seriously ill and might die , and then the mourning would delay the wedding still longer .
Levin looked out of the window at the sun sinking behind the bare tree @-@ tops of the forest .
There was no kitchen maid to be found ; of the nine cows , it appeared from the words of the cowherd @-@ woman that some were about to calve , others had just calved , others were old , and others again hard @-@ uddered ; there was not butter nor milk enough even for the children .
&quot; And all my gossip is exhausted .
A change began to come over his work , which gave him immense satisfaction .
The head lay sideways on the pillow .
The only happy marriages I know are marriages of prudence . &quot; &quot; Yes , but then how often the happiness of these prudent marriages flies away like dust just because that passion turns up that they have refused to recognize , &quot; said Vronsky .
Good @-@ bye ! &quot; And he was going away , but now she detained him .
What am I to say to her ? &quot; thought Kitty , and she stopped in the doorway .
But as he drove into the meadow , and recalled the sensations of mowing , he came near deciding that he would go mowing .
On reaching the meadow Levin stopped the horse .
By his action he had , as it were , washed away the shame and humiliation he had felt before .
&quot; Make haste , &quot; she said .
We must take our line , &quot; he said .
The bailiff , who had been to the merchant , had come back and brought part of the money for the wheat .
&quot; I &apos;ve asked her , but she seems put out about something . &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;ve not noticed it , maman , &quot; said Kitty , flushing hotly .
After his levee , that is to say , giving directions about the labors of the next day , and seeing all the peasants who had business with him , Levin went back to his study and sat down to work .
Another little set with which Anna was in close relations was the one by means of which Alexey Alexandrovitch had made his career .
Woman is deprived of rights from lack of education , and the lack of education results from the absence of rights .
&quot; How glad I am you &apos;ve been seeing him ! &quot; said Sludin .
The English governess in altering it had made the seams in the wrong place , had taken up the sleeves too much , and altogether spoilt the dress .
Korsunsky bowed , set straight his open shirt front , and gave her his arm to conduct her to Anna Arkadyevna .
He remembered the shameful proceedings he had tried to get up against his brother Sergey Ivanovitch , accusing him of not having paid him his share of his mother &apos;s fortune , and the last scandal , when he had gone to a western province in an official capacity , and there had got into trouble for assaulting a village elder ....
But over her own daughters she had felt how far from simple and easy is the business , apparently so commonplace , of marrying off one &apos;s daughters .
I &apos;ll beat you ! &quot; he shouted .
And not without inward pride , and not without reason , he thought that any other man would long ago have been in difficulties , would have been forced to some dishonorable course , if he had found himself in such a difficult position .
&quot; Oh , it &apos;s so idiotic !
He called to the driver to stop before reaching the avenue , and opening the door , jumped out of the carriage as it was moving , and went into the avenue that led up to the house .
Alexey Alexandrovitch did not stir , and kept looking straight before him .
It was coming back from there that I met your _ beau @-@ frère _ in the train , or your _ beau @-@ frère &apos;s _ brother @-@ in @-@ law , &quot; he said with a smile .
What was extraordinary was that everyone not only liked him , but even people previously unsympathetic , cold , and callous , were enthusiastic over him , gave way to him in everything , treated his feeling with tenderness and delicacy , and shared his conviction that he was the happiest man in the world because his betrothed was beyond perfection .
On his return to Moscow he informed his wife with pride that everything was ready , that the house would be a little paradise , and that he advised her most certainly to go .
He soon felt that the realization of his desires gave him no more than a grain of sand out of the mountain of happiness he had expected .
He walked with his firm tread twice up and down the little cage of a room , blinked his eyelids that his tears might not fall , and only then sat down to the table .
It seems to me he thinks all I want is to be married .
But every time he began talking to her , he felt that the spirit of evil and deceit , which had taken possession of her , had possession of him too , and he talked to her in a tone quite unlike that in which he had meant to talk .
You must not , you must not act in haste ! &quot; &quot; I am not acting in haste , &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch said coldly , &quot; but one cannot ask advice of anyone in such a matter .
He looked at her as a man looks at a faded flower he has gathered , with difficulty recognizing in it the beauty for which he picked and ruined it .
Chapter 4 The personal matter that absorbed Levin during his conversation with his brother was this .
Sergey Ivanovitch used to say that he knew and liked the peasantry , and he often talked to the peasants , which he knew how to do without affectation or condescension , and from every such conversation he would deduce general conclusions in favor of the peasantry and in confirmation of his knowing them .
Now you may beg as you please , but I won &apos;t be open with you .
And the Tatar ran off with flying coat @-@ tails , and in five minutes darted in with a dish of opened oysters on mother @-@ of @-@ pearl shells , and a bottle between his fingers .
It seems to me they &apos;re taking stock of me and summing me up .
&quot; Have you seen Mihailov &apos;s picture ? &quot; he said , handing him a Russian gazette he had received that morning , and pointing to an article on a Russian artist , living in the very same town , and just finishing a picture which had long been talked about , and had been bought beforehand .
Anna &apos;s portrait - the same subject painted from nature both by him and by Mihailov - ought to have shown Vronsky the difference between him and Mihailov ; but he did not see it .
But Betsy did not hear her .
That was a misfortune ; but that , too , is an accomplished fact .
There were no eggs .
She was feeling ecstasy .
&quot; He &apos;s not worth your grieving over him , &quot; pursued Darya Alexandrovna , coming straight to the point .
&quot; Ah ! &quot; she cried , seeing him , and beaming with delight .
&quot; But my child ! &quot; she shrieked .
&quot; How was it you didn &apos;t let me know before , that is , at the time of my wedding ?
&quot; A man &apos;s strength has its limits , countess , and I have reached my limits .
He could not be mistaken .
I will be your housekeeper .
&quot; Yes , &quot; she began ; &quot; yes , yes , yes .
The article reproached the government and the academy for letting so remarkable an artist be left without encouragement and support .
Look how lovely it is out on the terrace , &quot; she said , turning first to one and then to the other .
&quot; Better , I think , &quot; she said , avoiding his eyes .
She moved nearer to her sister @-@ in @-@ law and took her hand in her vigorous little hand .
&quot; I only say that both sides have strong arguments to support them , &quot; he went on , addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch .
&quot; Yes , it &apos;s true now , that &apos;s another thing ; but that _ now _ won &apos;t last forever . &quot; &quot; Perhaps , &quot; answered Vronsky .
The doctors say there is no hope .
An hour later Varya , his brother &apos;s wife , had arrived , and with the assistance of three doctors , whom she had sent for in all directions , and who all appeared at the same moment , she got the wounded man to bed , and remained to nurse him .
In another man &apos;s house , and especially in Vronsky &apos;s palazzo , Mihailov was quite a different man from what he was in his studio .
With his habitual control over his thoughts , though he thought all this about his wife , he did not let his thoughts stray further in regard to her .
His brows were scowling , and his eyes gleamed with a proud and angry light in them .
I &apos;m the only one , and it was hard for me even .
) - Alexey would not refuse me .
Galtsin , a friend of Vronsky &apos;s and one of his more formidable rivals , was moving round a bay horse that would not let him mount .
&quot; What is she like , what is she like ?
Vronsky patted her strong neck , straightened over her sharp withers a stray lock of her mane that had fallen on the other side , and moved his face near her dilated nostrils , transparent as a bat &apos;s wing .
And in fact , Golenishtchev &apos;s manner to Madame Karenina , when he was taken to call on her , was all that Vronsky could have desired .
Anna Arkadyevna Karenina had friends and close ties in three different circles of this highest society .
The majority of the younger men envied him for just what was the most irksome factor in his love - the exalted position of Karenin , and the consequent publicity of their connection in society .
Pestsov insisted that one country can only absorb another when it is the more densely populated .
&quot; Delightful ball ! &quot; he said to her , for the sake of saying something .
Leave Seryozha till my ...
She laid her hand on his sleeve , dazzling and white with its rings in the lamplight .
Not all wives are so kind as you , to be in such a hurry to communicate such agreeable news to their husbands . &quot; He laid special emphasis on the word &quot; agreeable . &quot; &quot; I shall ignore it so long as the world knows nothing of it , so long as my name is not disgraced .
&quot; I can &apos;t believe you love me , dear ! &quot; She smiled at that &quot; dear , &quot; and at the timidity with which he glanced at her .
&quot; Yes , I ought to have said to him : You say that our husbandry does not answer because the peasant hates improvements , and that they must be forced on him by authority .
&quot; You didn &apos;t even shake hands with him .
Women are the chief stumbling block in a man &apos;s career .
They sent to Stepan Arkadyevitch &apos;s and brought a shirt - it was impossibly wide and short .
But in our day he goes straight for the literature of negation , very quickly assimilates all the extracts of the science of negation , and he &apos;s ready .
When will it be ? &quot; The ironical light died away in her eyes , but a different smile , a consciousness of something , he did not know what , and of quiet melancholy , came over her face .
&quot; This is an unhappy fatality , and one must accept it as such .
&quot; What have they been ploughing ? &quot; asked Levin .
To muddle up two trades is the error of the amateur ; I &apos;m not one of their number . &quot; &quot; How happy I shall be when I hear that you &apos;re in love ! &quot; said Levin .
Levin went out onto the steps .
You didn &apos;t think I had a love story too , &quot; she said , and there was a faint gleam in her handsome face of that fire which Kitty felt must once have glowed all over her .
At such moments particularly , Alexey Alexandrovitch had a sense of perfect peace and inward harmony , and saw nothing extraordinary in his position , nothing that ought to be changed .
It was introduced maybe in the days before the Empire , but it was probably brought in by force .
He looked at her hair done up high , with the long white veil and white flowers and the high , stand @-@ up , scalloped collar , that in such a maidenly fashion hid her long neck at the sides and only showed it in front , her strikingly slender figure , and it seemed to him that she looked better than ever - not because these flowers , this veil , this gown from Paris added anything to her beauty ; but because , in spite of the elaborate sumptuousness of her attire , the expression of her sweet face , of her eyes , of her lips was still her own characteristic expression of guileless truthfulness .
&quot; Of course , I &apos;m right , and he &apos;s right , and it &apos;s all first @-@ rate .
Later on he had been engrossed in other questions , and had simply forgotten the Board of Irrigation .
Levin , number seven , eh ?
At first the princess noticed nothing but that Kitty was much under the influence of her _ engouement _ , as she called it , for Madame Stahl , and still more for Varenka .
&quot; Yes , yes , yes - you &apos;re right ; you &apos;re right ! &quot; And he saw all that Pestsov had been maintaining at dinner of the liberty of woman , simply from getting a glimpse of the terror of an old maid &apos;s existence and its humiliation in Kitty &apos;s heart ; and loving her , he felt that terror and humiliation , and at once gave up his arguments .
&quot; Let us talk of your affairs .
No , tell me all you think !
&quot; Well , you must go and get them without me . &quot; &quot; Ah , that &apos;s the truth , &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch .
We rent a bit of land too .
&quot; What !
&quot; The question , I imagine , is simply whether they are fitted for such duties . &quot; &quot; They will most likely be perfectly fitted , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , &quot; when education has become general among them .
When he got out of the train at Petersburg , he felt after his sleepless night as keen and fresh as after a cold bath .
&quot; You &apos;ve said nothing , of course , and I ask nothing , &quot; he was saying ; &quot; but you know that friendship &apos;s not what I want : that there &apos;s only one happiness in life for me , that word that you dislike so ... yes , love ! ... &quot; &quot; Love , &quot; she repeated slowly , in an inner voice , and suddenly , at the very instant she unhooked the lace , she added , &quot; Why I don &apos;t like the word is that it means too much to me , far more than you can understand , &quot; and she glanced into his face .
The thought of her husband &apos;s unhappiness did not poison her happiness .
The old man had been awake a long while , and was sitting up whetting the scythes of the younger lads .
Chapter 4 Darya Alexandrovna , in a dressing jacket , and with her now scanty , once luxuriant and beautiful hair fastened up with hairpins on the nape of her neck , with a sunken , thin face and large , startled eyes , which looked prominent from the thinness of her face , was standing among a litter of all sorts of things scattered all over the room , before an open bureau , from which she was taking something .
&quot; Not at all .
He felt , as it were , that he had to be in love with one of the sisters , only he could not quite make out which .
do you mean to say it &apos;s not of importance ? &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch , stung to the quick too at his brother &apos;s considering anything of no importance that interested him , and still more at his obviously paying little attention to what he was saying .
After writing for a little while , Levin suddenly thought with exceptional vividness of Kitty , her refusal , and their last meeting .
Nikolay Shtcherbatsky , Kitty &apos;s cousin , in a short jacket and tight trousers , was sitting on a garden seat with his skates on .
Come on , Tit !
You gave me two measures .
He made the offer , and concentrated on his betrothed and his wife all the feeling of which he was capable .
&quot; What &apos;s the matter ?
His eyes rested upon Anna .
&quot; Very glad to meet you again , &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch coldly , shaking hands with Levin .
Nikolay Levin went on talking : &quot; You know that capital oppresses the laborer .
Beg her forgiveness , sir .
&quot; If I did not like you , &quot; she said , and tears came into her eyes ; &quot; if I did not know you , as I do know you .... &quot; The feeling that had seemed dead revived more and more , rose up and took possession of Levin &apos;s heart .
She concealed them not because she did not respect or did not love her mother , but simply because she was her mother .
He cut off and spread with cheese a wafer of bread fine as a spider @-@ web .
What was pictured so clearly to Kitty in the mirror of Anna &apos;s face she saw in him .
From the fifth sitting the portrait impressed everyone , especially Vronsky , not only by its resemblance , but by its characteristic beauty .
&quot; And how I loved him !
He doesn &apos;t exist . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not speaking sincerely .
&quot; Varenka , mamma &apos;s calling ! &quot; they cried .
He believed neither in God nor the devil , but was much concerned about the question of the improvement of the clergy and the maintenance of their revenues , and took special trouble to keep up the church in his village .
Take me up , please .
&quot; No , &quot; he said ; &quot; I would point out the fact that if , as Pripasov directly asserts , perception is based on sensation , then we are bound to distinguish sharply between these two conceptions . &quot; Levin listened no more , and simply waited for the professor to go .
&quot; I &apos;m tired , and was just longing to have some tea before they come .
He felt unutterably wretched now , for his passion for Anna , which had seemed to him of late to be growing cooler , now that he knew he had lost her forever , was stronger than ever it had been .
She played nervously with the tassel of her dressing @-@ gown , glancing at him with that torturing sensation of physical repulsion for which she blamed herself , though she could not control it .
What a good thing you let us know !
Pay up , &quot; said he , smiling .
Princess Myakaya , sitting in the middle between the two groups , and listening to both , took part in the conversation first of one and then of the other .
&quot; Ah , Konstantin Dmitrievitch !
Though he did not acknowledge it to himself , Alexey Alexandrovitch always tried nowadays to secure the presence of a third person in his interviews with his wife .
The princess for her part , going round the question in the manner peculiar to women , maintained that Kitty was too young , that Levin had done nothing to prove that he had serious intentions , that Kitty felt no great attraction to him , and other side issues ; but she did not state the principal point , which was that she looked for a better match for her daughter , and that Levin was not to her liking , and she did not understand him .
It was only when the same evening he came to their house before the theater , went into her room and saw her tear @-@ stained , pitiful , sweet face , miserable with suffering he had caused and nothing could undo , he felt the abyss that separated his shameful past from her dovelike purity , and was appalled at what he had done .
Yet , elevated as Madame Stahl &apos;s character was , touching as was her story , and exalted and moving as was her speech , Kitty could not help detecting in her some traits which perplexed her .
I &apos;ll come along directly .
And now don &apos;t I love him ?
what have I done !
Reddening , she stretched out towards him expecting a kiss , but he only patted her hair and said : &quot; These stupid chignons !
I should have to leave him , and I can &apos;t and won &apos;t do that . &quot; &quot; But , for God &apos;s sake , which is better ? - leave your child , or keep up this degrading position ? &quot; &quot; To whom is it degrading ? &quot; &quot; To all , and most of all to you . &quot; &quot; You say degrading ... don &apos;t say that .
&quot; Well , here &apos;s visitors come to us , and you won &apos;t be dull , &quot; said Agafea Mihalovna , getting up and going to the door .
To break it , and to show he was not agitated , he made an effort and addressed Golenishtchev .
&quot; What was it ?
It never even entered his head that there could be any harm in his relations with Kitty .
This hotel had already reached that stage , and the soldier in a filthy uniform smoking in the entry , supposed to stand for a hall @-@ porter , and the cast @-@ iron , slippery , dark , and disagreeable staircase , and the free and easy waiter in a filthy frock coat , and the common dining @-@ room with a dusty bouquet of wax flowers adorning the table , and filth , dust , and disorder everywhere , and at the same time the sort of modern up @-@ to @-@ date self @-@ complacent railway uneasiness of this hotel , aroused a most painful feeling in Levin after their fresh young life , especially because the impression of falsity made by the hotel was so out of keeping with what awaited them .
&quot; Here he is ! &quot; shouted the colonel .
&quot; Ah !
Every man who knows to the minutest details all the complexity of the conditions surrounding him , cannot help imagining that the complexity of these conditions , and the difficulty of making them clear , is something exceptional and personal , peculiar to himself , and never supposes that others are surrounded by just as complicated an array of personal affairs as he is .
&quot; I am very glad it gives you pleasure , &quot; Varenka answered simply .
I would offer the other cheek , I would give my cloak if my coat be taken .
Outwardly everything was the same , but their inner relations were completely changed .
And how vulgarly she shouted , &quot; he said to himself , remembering her shriek and the words - &quot; scoundrel &quot; and &quot; mistress . &quot; &quot; And very likely the maids were listening !
She knew that whatever he might say to her , he would not say all he thought .
She does not want anything , does not dare ask you for anything , she leaves it all to your generosity . &quot; &quot; My God , my God !
He did not in his heart respect his mother , and without acknowledging it to himself , he did not love her , though in accordance with the ideas of the set in which he lived , and with his own education , he could not have conceived of any behavior to his mother not in the highest degree respectful and obedient , and the more externally obedient and respectful his behavior , the less in his heart he respected and loved her .
I &apos;ve been bothering about it for ever so long .
&quot; Bravo !
Maybe it will be fine . &quot; Levin went up to his brother .
I allowed that their conduct was bad , but I urged him to take into consideration their heedlessness , their youth ; then , too , the young men had only just been lunching together .
&quot; Katya , go away ! &quot; he added .
Remembering Golenishtchev , a thin , lively , good @-@ natured and well @-@ bred boy , always at the head of the class , Vronsky could not make out the reason of his irritability , and he did not like it .
&quot; I want to warn you , &quot; he said in a low voice , &quot; that through thoughtlessness and lack of caution you may cause yourself to be talked about in society .
His tailor was trying to get him locked up , and another fellow , too , was threatening to get him locked up .
He &apos;s jealous of me !
Then she recalled the thin , terribly thin figure of Petrov , with his long neck , in his brown coat , his scant , curly hair , his questioning blue eyes that were so terrible to Kitty at first , and his painful attempts to seem hearty and lively in her presence .
She knitted her brow , trying to understand .
Before the early dawn all was hushed .
&quot; Of course ; he was at our sitting yesterday .
&quot; Imagine !
&quot; Ah , mamma , we have plenty of troubles of our own .
The farming of the land , as he was managing it , had become not merely unattractive but revolting to him , and he could take no further interest in it .
&quot; Very well then , let it be as though we had not spoken of this .
&quot; It &apos;s a pity Vassya &apos;s asleep . &quot; After seeing the children , they sat down , alone now , in the drawing @-@ room , to coffee .
The prince was on Levin &apos;s side ; he said he wished for nothing better for Kitty .
On completing his high school and university courses with medals , Alexey Alexandrovitch had , with his uncle &apos;s aid , immediately started in a prominent position in the service , and from that time forward he had devoted himself exclusively to political ambition .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , and I &apos;ll never think ill of people again ! &quot; he said gaily , genuinely expressing what he felt at the moment .
Vronsky , have a drink ? &quot; said Petritsky , getting up and wrapping the tiger @-@ skin rug round him .
&quot; I ? &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , &quot; there &apos;s nothing I desire so much as that - nothing !
&quot; No , I &apos;m not nice at all .
Secondly , he would never again let himself give way to low passion , the memory of which had so tortured him when he had been making up his mind to make an offer .
&quot; Do just as you like , only let it be as soon as possible , &quot; he said , and went to the bailiff .
He found her in tears .
He had made up his mind to revolutionize his whole system .
On the spot the officers set off in pursuit of her ; she was alarmed , and feeling still more unwell , ran up the staircase home .
Better not go in , it &apos;ll excite the mare . &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m going in .
We pay the money , and it all goes in salaries , and there are no schools , nor district nurses , nor midwives , nor drugstores - nothing . &quot; &quot; Well , I did try , you know , &quot; Levin said slowly and unwillingly .
She felt that at that moment she could not put into words the sense of shame , of rapture , and of horror at this stepping into a new life , and she did not want to speak of it , to vulgarize this feeling by inappropriate words .
&quot; Yes , you &apos;re done for , &quot; resumed Oblonsky .
He &apos;s so much to be pitied ! &quot; she said to herself directly after .
The argument turned out to be far simpler than he had expected .
They did not realize that the hand was near twelve .
Behind walked Madame Karenina with her brother .
It &apos;s very hot in here . &quot; And she opened the door .
&quot; Ferreting in one &apos;s soul , one often ferrets out something that might have lain there unnoticed .
And here come some poached eggs , my favorite dish .
For two minutes , his head bent forward with an expression of an intense effort of thought , he stood with the revolver in his hand , motionless , thinking .
She disengaged the letter and began reading it at the end .
But , do you know ?
Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed , plucking up his courage .
&quot; Oh , it &apos;s awful , it &apos;s awful !
I know , I know all about it . &quot; She wished for what her mother wished for , but the motives of her mother &apos;s wishes wounded her .
&quot; She pressed me very much to go and see her , &quot; Anna went on ; &quot; and I shall be glad to go to see her tomorrow .
There &apos;s nothing so terrible in it . &quot; And Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled .
But something drew her towards it , and she could yield to it or resist it at will .
And only then for the first time the whole thing presented itself in a new , different aspect ; only then she realized that the question did not affect her only - with whom she would be happy , and whom she loved - but that she would have that moment to wound a man whom she liked .
&quot; _ Tout ça est une blague _ .
In that smile , too , Alexey Alexandrovitch saw a sneer at his position .
That can &apos;t be . &quot; &quot; I did so want you all to care for me , as I do for you , and now I care for you more than ever , &quot; said Anna , with tears in her eyes .
&quot; Will you really not have tea ?
It all seemed to her a far simpler matter : all that was needed , as Marya Philimonovna had explained , was to give Brindle and Whitebreast more food and drink , and not to let the cook carry all the kitchen slops to the laundry maid &apos;s cow .
But there are ways of doing everything .
She longed to question him as to where his master was .
You must take the sacrament . &quot; &quot; When ?
&quot; Your brother &apos;s been here , &quot; he said to Vronsky .
&quot; Countess Vronskaya is in that compartment , &quot; said the smart guard , going up to Vronsky .
&quot; Of course , not now , &quot; thought Levin , &quot; but some day later on . &quot; Levin felt more than ever now that there was something not clear and not clean in his soul , and that , in regard to religion , he was in the same position which he perceived so clearly and disliked in others , and for which he blamed his friend Sviazhsky .
I am going away , and taking my son with me .
The colonel smiled , as he always did , at the prince &apos;s jokes , but as far as regards Europe , of which he believed himself to be making a careful study , he took the princess &apos;s side .
I will certainly ride over to her , &quot; said Levin .
Already , from the sound of light steps on the stairs , he was aware that she was close , and though he was satisfied with his speech , he felt frightened of the explanation confronting him .... Chapter 9 Anna came in with hanging head , playing with the tassels of her hood .
The mare &apos;s fidgety , &quot; he added , nodding towards the horse @-@ box , before which they were standing , and from which came the sound of restless stamping in the straw .
He ran up the stairs seeing no one and nothing , and with a rapid step , almost breaking into a run , he went into her room .
The thought of immediate action binding her to her son , of going away somewhere with him , gave her this consolation .
On entering the study Ryabinin looked about , as his habit was , as though seeking the holy picture , but when he had found it , he did not cross himself .
&quot; Vronsky !
&quot; Oh , yes !
&quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch ! &quot; Princess Betsy called to him ; &quot; I &apos;m sure you don &apos;t see your wife : here she is . &quot; He smiled his chilly smile .
Capital !
The race course was a large three @-@ mile ring of the form of an ellipse in front of the pavilion .
I &apos;ve tried , and I see I can do nothing , &quot; said Levin .
Oh , my God , my God ! &quot; And she tossed about on the bed .
But Alexey Alexandrovitch did not now attach any special significance to this tone of hers .
No , all he wants is falsehood and propriety , &quot; Anna said to herself , not considering exactly what it was she wanted of her husband , and how she would have liked to see him behave .
He assented to what his brother said , but he could not help beginning to think of other things .
But this won &apos;t do , you know .
Stremov , who was also a member of the Commission , and also stung to the quick , began defending himself , and altogether a stormy sitting followed ; but Alexey Alexandrovitch triumphed , and his motion was carried , three new commissions were appointed , and the next day in a certain Petersburg circle nothing else was talked of but this sitting .
Sergey Ivanovitch smiled .
I won &apos;t say it &apos;s not generous , but it &apos;s not like a gentleman to strike anyone who &apos;s down . &quot; &quot; Yes , you only think of yourself !
The mysterious , enchanting Kitty herself could not love such an ugly person as he conceived himself to be , and , above all , such an ordinary , in no way striking person .
Chapter 30 At the end of September the timber had been carted for building the cattleyard on the land that had been allotted to the association of peasants , and the butter from the cows was sold and the profits divided .
Even supposing one parts from her , so as not to break up one &apos;s family life , still , can one help feeling for her , setting her on her feet , softening her lot ? &quot; &quot; Well , you must excuse me there .
&quot; I will take the disgrace on myself , I will give up even my son , but ... but wouldn &apos;t it be better to let it alone ?
The steward was prepared to sign the agreement .
&quot; What are they talking about , and why doesn &apos;t he go back ? &quot; thought Levin , not guessing that the peasants had been mowing no less than four hours without stopping , and it was time for their lunch .
&quot; No , no , it can &apos;t be !
She had called him &quot; Stiva , &quot; and he glanced at her with gratitude , and moved to take her hand , but she drew back from him with aversion .
&quot; Perhaps .
To consent to a divorce , to give her her freedom , meant in his thoughts to take from himself the last tie that bound him to life - the children whom he loved ; and to take from her the last prop that stayed her on the path of right , to thrust her down to her ruin .
But Vronsky felt that now especially it was essential for him to clear up and define his position if he were to avoid getting into difficulties .
No one knows him ; but I know him .
She went up to Alexey Alexandrovitch , and with the familiarity given by the approach of death took him by the arm and drew him towards the bedroom .
&quot; We spent three hours together in the train , &quot; said Levin smiling , &quot; but got out , just as in a masquerade , quite mystified - at least I was . &quot; &quot; Nonsense !
But apart from this , what more than all made divorce seem impossible to Alexey Alexandrovitch was , that by consenting to a divorce he would be completely ruining Anna .
Gray old Laska , who had followed them , sat down warily opposite him and pricked up her ears .
&quot; No , he &apos;s depressing .
This idiotic smile he could not forgive himself .
You say schools , education , will give them fresh wants .
We &apos;ve no Ostend . &quot; &quot; Flensburg will do , but are they fresh ? &quot; &quot; Only arrived yesterday . &quot; &quot; Well , then , how if we were to begin with oysters , and so change the whole program ?
With whom am I going to work the system , allow me to ask ? &quot; &quot; There it is - the labor force - the chief element in agriculture , &quot; thought Levin .
In the morning the sun rose brilliant and quickly wore away the thin layer of ice that covered the water , and all the warm air was quivering with the steam that rose up from the quickened earth .
He forgave his wife and pitied her for her sufferings and her remorse .
She got up and pulled herself together ; she realized that they had reached a station and that this was the guard .
Why , we didn &apos;t expect you !
On waking up the day after the races , Vronsky put on a white linen coat , and without shaving or taking his bath , he distributed about the table moneys , bills , and letters , and set to work .
No , I &apos;m not going .
A feeling such as his was profaned by talk of the rivalry of some Petersburg officer , of the suppositions and the counsels of Stepan Arkadyevitch .
&quot; It &apos;s too early for Betsy , &quot; she thought , and glancing out of the window she caught sight of the carriage and the black hat of Alexey Alexandrovitch , and the ears that she knew so well sticking up each side of it .
&quot; Well , how &apos;s it to be then ? - unlighted or lighted candles ?
His pleasure was only disturbed by his row not being well cut .
&quot; And you &apos;ll drink something ?
This first quarrel arose from Levin &apos;s having gone out to a new farmhouse and having been away half an hour too long , because he had tried to get home by a short cut and had lost his way .
&quot; You can go , Dunyasha , I &apos;ll call you presently , &quot; said Kitty .
&quot; How did they guess that it is help , just help that one wants ? &quot; he thought , recalling all his fears and doubts of late .
Even the holy fathers had doubts , and prayed to God to strengthen their faith .
They were just lifting it into the van , &quot; said Kouzma .
And she knew that her last hope had failed her .
It was Friday , and in the dining @-@ room the German watchmaker was winding up the clock .
&quot; With you I should soon learn ; I somehow feel confidence in you , &quot; she said to him .
&quot; Yes , &quot; answered Levin , and he told Kouzma to put out his clothes for him to dress .
The thought that the new chief might not tender him a warm reception was the other unpleasant thing .
But now we know that these little pills of classical learning possess the medicinal property of anti @-@ nihilism , and we boldly prescribe them to our patients ....
I shall die ; and I &apos;m very glad I shall die , and release myself and you . &quot; Tears dropped from her eyes ; he bent down over her hand and began kissing it , trying to hide his emotion , which , he knew , had no sort of grounds , though he could not control it .
I wanted to have a little talk with you about my sister and your mutual position , &quot; he said , still struggling with an unaccustomed constraint .
He knew that for this , for the very fact that his heart was torn with grief , they would be merciless to him .
Get me a subject .
&quot; Ah ! &quot; she said , as though surprised .
Then remembering his brother Nikolay , he resolved to himself that he would never allow himself to forget him , that he would follow him up , and not lose sight of him , so as to be ready to help when things should go ill with him .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m becoming ridiculous . &quot; He was very well aware that he ran no risk of being ridiculous in the eyes of Betsy or any other fashionable people .
No , my children won &apos;t be like that . &quot; He said good @-@ bye and drove away , and she did not try to keep him .
The hand did not respond to her pressure , but the face of Mademoiselle Varenka glowed with a soft , glad , though rather mournful smile , that showed large but handsome teeth .
She was a specialist in the matter of deputations , and no one knew better than she how to manage them , and put them in the way they should go .
&quot; No , I don &apos;t throw stones , &quot; she was saying , in answer to something , &quot; though I can &apos;t understand it , &quot; she went on , shrugging her shoulders , and she turned at once with a soft smile of protection towards Kitty .
He said respectfully , &quot; nothing can be done , the peasants are such a wretched lot , &quot; and did nothing to help her .
&quot; It &apos;s late , Alexey Alexandrovitch , &quot; she said , when she had gone through the doorway .
Anna did not go out that evening either to the Princess Betsy Tverskaya , who , hearing of her return , had invited her , nor to the theater , where she had a box for that evening .
At that moment a tall general walked through the pavilion .
With a flying , feminine glance she scanned her attire , and made a movement of her head , hardly perceptible , but understood by Kitty , signifying approval of her dress and her looks .
&quot; When shall we see each other ? &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t deserve it , &quot; answered Betsy , smiling .
He &apos;s not a man , he &apos;s an official machine .
And , oh dear !
She saw at once that he had been thinking about it before by himself .
All at once a gentleman appears with whiskers like sausages , as red as a lobster , announces that there is no one living in the flat except his wife , and sends them both about their business . &quot; &quot; How do you know he had whiskers like sausages , as you say ? &quot; &quot; Ah , you shall hear .
yes , &quot; he said , to the announcement that Vronsky had been at the Tverskoys &quot; ; and his black eyes shining , he plucked at his left mustache , and began twisting it into his mouth , a bad habit he had .
Now I cannot let you disgrace my name , - &quot; &quot; &quot; and my son , &quot; she had meant to say , but about her son she could not jest , - &quot; &quot; disgrace my name , and &quot; - and more in the same style , &quot; she added .
He knelt down , and laying his head in the curve of her arm , which burned him as with fire through the sleeve , he sobbed like a little child .
Your son ? &quot; asked Levin .
&quot; You do not admit the conceivability at all ? &quot; he queried .
&quot; Yes , but joking apart , &quot; resumed Stepan Arkadyevitch , &quot; you must understand that the woman is a sweet , gentle loving creature , poor and lonely , and has sacrificed everything .
&quot; Why , Alexey Alexandrovitch , what are you cutting us like this for ? &quot; said Dolly , smiling .
&quot; I don &apos;t even dispute it . &quot; At that instant Marya Nikolaevna came back .
Kitty returned home to Russia cured .
It &apos;s a sort of madness .
&quot; I don &apos;t talk about you , not about you at all .
&quot; Have you been here long ? &quot; he added .
She always seemed absorbed in work about which there could be no doubt , and so it seemed she could not take interest in anything outside it .
&quot; Possibly it does not pay , &quot; answered Sviazhsky .
They had teased him , called him Noah , and monk ; and , when he had broken out , no one had helped him , but everyone had turned away from him with horror and disgust .
&quot; The point is , don &apos;t you see , that progress of every sort is only made by the use of authority , &quot; he said , evidently wishing to show he was not without culture .
&quot; Have mercy on us again ! &quot; thought Levin , crossing himself , bowing , and looking at the supple spring of the deacon &apos;s back bowing before him .
What do you mean ? &quot; he asked in perplexity , speaking in French .
He had himself thought about Pilate &apos;s figure just what Golenishtchev said .
Alexey Alexandrovitch replied defending them .
He hastily put down the dumbbells .
And though the answer meant nothing , the general looked as though he had heard a witty remark from a witty man , and fully relished _ la pointe de la sauce _ .
He looked at a moth that flew before his nose , and moved his hands , but did not catch it from regard for Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s position .
Almost at the same instant the hostess , with freshly arranged coiffure and freshened face , walked in at one door and her guests at the other door of the drawing @-@ room , a large room with dark walls , downy rugs , and a brightly lighted table , gleaming with the light of candles , white cloth , silver samovar , and transparent china tea @-@ things .
&quot; No , you did quite , quite right to come , &quot; he said , and was silent again .
I unhappy ?
If it had been unsuccessful he would not have bought land at thirty @-@ five roubles the acre , he would not have married his three sons and a nephew , he would not have rebuilt twice after fires , and each time on a larger scale .
From the sheds he could see a perfect sea of carriages , and people on foot , soldiers surrounding the race course , and pavilions swarming with people .
&quot; Yes , but still all this has to be looked after , and who is there to look after it ? &quot; Darya Alexandrovna responded , without interest .
The gentleman does nothing , while the peasant works and supplants the idle man .
&quot; An enemy ?
We must not forget that the subjection of women is so complete , and dates from such ages back that we are often unwilling to recognize the gulf that separates them from us , &quot; said he .
The one thing the husband had a right to was to demand satisfaction with a weapon in his hand , and Vronsky was prepared for this at any minute .
Chapter 25 In the Surovsky district there was no railway nor service of post horses , and Levin drove there with his own horses in his big , old @-@ fashioned carriage .
The picture came to a standstill .
The business of the forest was over , the money in his pocket ; their shooting had been excellent , and Stepan Arkadyevitch was in the happiest frame of mind , and so he felt specially anxious to dissipate the ill @-@ humor that had come upon Levin .
Damnation !
The members of this deputation had not the slightest conception of their duty and the part they were to play .
&quot; My baby , &quot; said the old man with a tender smile .
To this class they all belonged , and in it the great thing was to be elegant , generous , plucky , gay , to abandon oneself without a blush to every passion , and to laugh at everything else .
Lands gone out of cultivation , overgrown with weeds , or divided among the peasants , and where millions of bushels were raised you get a hundred thousand ; the wealth of the country has decreased .
&quot; No , I am not going to stay , &quot; answered Anna , smiling , but in spite of her smile , both Korsunsky and the master of the house saw from her resolute tone that she would not stay .
&quot; Yes , it &apos;s wonderfully funny the way he talks .
That I love someone else ?
&quot; Did you get my note ? &quot; he said .
&quot; Yes , yes , so , &quot; the dying man articulated slowly at intervals .
Anna felt as though she were sinking down .
Yashvin got up too , stretching his long legs and his long back .
It &apos;s happiness is the matter with me !
Contrary to his usual habit , he did not get into bed , but fell to walking up and down the rooms with his hands clasped behind his back .
Vaska bowed once more to Anna , but he said nothing to her .
&quot; Only one alternative is possible : undesigned detection , supported by letters which I have . &quot; At the mention of letters the lawyer pursed up his lips , and gave utterance to a thin little compassionate and contemptuous sound .
But other people &apos;s criticisms , whatever they might be , had yet immense consequence in his eyes , and they agitated him to the depths of his soul .
And I tell you - I did make an offer and was rejected , and Katerina Alexandrovna is nothing now to me but a painful and humiliating reminiscence . &quot; &quot; What ever for ?
&quot; Mind , &quot; he said , pointing to the open window opposite the coachman .
&quot; Yes , that &apos;s someone from the railway station , &quot; he thought , &quot; just the time to be here from the Moscow train ... Who could it be ?
&quot; Yes , &quot; Anna went on .
Excuse me , I must leave you for a minute .
Haven &apos;t I struggled to love him , to love my son when I could not love my husband ?
The shaft @-@ horses were tilted against the shafts by the ruts , but the dexterous driver sitting on the box held the shaft over the ruts , so that the wheels ran on the smooth part of the road .
Imagine , I ought to have said to him , that you have the same system as the old peasant has , that you have found means of making your laborers take an interest in the success of the work , and have found the happy mean in the way of improvements which they will admit , and you will , without exhausting the soil , get twice or three times the yield you got before .
When he had gone into the little drawing @-@ room , where he always had tea , and had settled himself in his armchair with a book , and Agafea Mihalovna had brought him tea , and with her usual , &quot; Well , I &apos;ll stay a while , sir , &quot; had taken a chair in the window , he felt that , however strange it might be , he had not parted from his daydreams , and that he could not live without them .
He felt that all his forces , hitherto dissipated , wasted , were centered on one thing , and bent with fearful energy on one blissful goal .
There were no proper cupboards for their clothes ; what cupboards there were either would not close at all , or burst open whenever anyone passed by them .
&quot; Well now , do dress me . &quot; He turned to Matvey and threw off his dressing @-@ gown decisively .
&quot; Please don &apos;t tell us about that horror . &quot; &quot; All right , I won &apos;t especially as everyone knows those horrors . &quot; &quot; And we should all go to see them if it were accepted as the correct thing , like the opera , &quot; chimed in Princess Myakaya .
She was standing in the doorway with Shtcherbatsky , looking at him .
A poor thrashing machine , or your Russian presser , they will break , but my steam press they don &apos;t break .
In your heart there was found love enough to forgive .... &quot; &quot; If it had not been for you , God knows what would have happened !
Why was I rude to her ?
The children are growing up , my husband has come back to his family , and feels his fault , is growing purer , better , and I live on ....
Alexey Alexandrovitch looked at Vronsky with displeasure , vaguely recalling who this was .
&quot; Well , finished ? &quot; he said , meeting Stepan Arkadyevitch upstairs .
Ambition was the old dream of his youth and childhood , a dream which he did not confess even to himself , though it was so strong that now this passion was even doing battle with his love .
To Konstantin Levin the country was good first because it afforded a field for labor , of the usefulness of which there could be no doubt .
He jumped up quickly .
In the pauses of complete stillness there came the rustle of last year &apos;s leaves , stirred by the thawing of the earth and the growth of the grass .
Before she had gone , the servants came in with their congratulations .
And there &apos;s Semyon .... &quot; &quot; Well , you should have taken some men from the thatching . &quot; &quot; And so I have , as it is . &quot; &quot; Where are the peasants , then ? &quot; &quot; Five are making compôte &quot; ( which meant compost ) , &quot; four are shifting the oats for fear of a touch of mildew , Konstantin Dmitrievitch . &quot; Levin knew very well that &quot; a touch of mildew &quot; meant that his English seed oats were already ruined .
The haystacks could not possibly contain fifty wagon @-@ loads each , and to convict the peasants Levin ordered the wagons that had carried the hay to be brought up directly , to lift one stack , and carry it into the barn .
But I believe he doesn &apos;t care about painting any more portraits , and so very likely he is in want .
Well , so we shan &apos;t be singing any more now , &quot; she added , turning towards the house .
He evidently quite misunderstood , and apparently intentionally misunderstood , the conditions upon which the land had been given to him .
It was only with his mother that he was at ease .
It never entered his head to analyze the details of the sick man &apos;s situation , to consider how that body was lying under the quilt , how those emaciated legs and thighs and spine were lying huddled up , and whether they could not be made more comfortable , whether anything could not be done to make things , if not better , at least less bad .
It seemed to her beyond doubt that her position was now made clear forever .
As soon as he arrived in Petersburg , people began to talk about him as a newly risen star of the first magnitude .
&quot; What is horrible in a trouble of this kind is that one cannot , as in any other - in loss , in death - bear one &apos;s trouble in peace , but that one must act , &quot; said he , as though guessing her thought .
Stepan Arkadyevitch frowned at Grinevitch &apos;s words , giving him thereby to understand that it was improper to pass judgment prematurely , and made him no reply .
But this news had not produced what she had expected in him ; he simply seemed as though he were resenting some affront .
&quot; This is how people go mad , &quot; he repeated , &quot; and how they shoot themselves ... to escape humiliation , &quot; he added slowly .
You have a character that &apos;s all of a piece , and you want the whole of life to be of a piece too - but that &apos;s not how it is .
No one has said that .
She sat down at the writing @-@ table , but instead of writing she clasped her hands on the table , and , laying her head on them , burst into tears , with sobs and heaving breast like a child crying .
He had scarcely got out of his carriage when his groom , the so @-@ called &quot; stable boy , &quot; recognizing the carriage some way off , called the trainer .
Madame Stahl talked to Kitty as to a charming child that one looks on with pleasure as on the memory of one &apos;s youth , and only once she said in passing that in all human sorrows nothing gives comfort but love and faith , and that in the sight of Christ &apos;s compassion for us no sorrow is trifling - and immediately talked of other things .
Those loaves , those doves , and those two boys were not earthly creatures .
Vronsky intentionally avoided that select crowd of the upper world , which was moving and talking with discreet freedom before the pavilions .
&quot; You tell Matvey to do what can &apos;t be done , and go away yourself , leaving him to make a muddle of everything , &quot; and her habitual , mocking smile curved the corners of Dolly &apos;s lips as she spoke .
&quot; To whom shall I announce your honor ? &quot; asked the footman .
Another disappointment and happy surprise came in their quarrels .
He pulls it from him , and hands it to the Grand Duchess .
Yes , as to your question , there is no change , but it &apos;s a pity you &apos;ve been away so long . &quot; &quot; Oh , why so ? &quot; Levin queried , panic @-@ stricken .
The confession he had promised was the one painful incident of this time .
But Mihailov remained equally chilly to all of them .
&quot; Come now , let us talk of you , &quot; she added , tossing her head , as though she would physically shake off something superfluous oppressing her .
&quot; Just so , &quot; Betsy agreed ; &quot; one must make mistakes and correct them .
&quot; I &apos;m not going to mention any names . &quot; &quot; But I shall guess , so much the better . &quot; &quot; Well , listen : two festive young men were driving - &quot; &quot; Officers of your regiment , of course ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say they were officers , - two young men who had been lunching . &quot; &quot; In other words , drinking . &quot; &quot; Possibly .
&quot; No , I &apos;m quite well , &quot; she said , getting up and pressing his outstretched hand tightly .
&quot; Have a wife ?
&quot; Yes , &quot; she mused , &quot; there was something unnatural about Anna Pavlovna , and utterly unlike her good nature , when she said angrily the day before yesterday : &quot; There , he will keep waiting for you ; he wouldn &apos;t drink his coffee without you , though he &apos;s grown so dreadfully weak . &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes , perhaps , too , she didn &apos;t like it when I gave him the rug .
Now I &apos;m going to arrange my life quite differently , &quot; he went on .
&quot; And what more am I to write to him ? &quot; she said to herself .
I used to think so too , but here I live and think life worth living not only for that . &quot; &quot; There it &apos;s out !
She had imagined him better than he was in reality .
Another difficulty lay in the invincible disbelief of the peasant that a landowner &apos;s object could be anything else than a desire to squeeze all he could out of them .
But it was the tone common to all the bailiffs he had ever had .
But when Stepan Arkadyevitch began to speak of the causes of Kitty &apos;s illness , and mentioned Vronsky &apos;s name , Levin cut him short .
No one knows him .
&quot; I don &apos;t think so , &quot; answered Betsy , and , without looking at her friend , she began filling the little transparent cups with fragrant tea .
He &apos;ll be coming ; it will hurt him to see her .
&quot; Who &apos;s that ?
&quot; Here is papa come , &quot; Kitty said to her .
These quarrels frequently arose from the fact that they did not yet know what was of importance to each other and that all this early period they were both often in a bad temper .
He considered human life only tolerable abroad , and went abroad to stay at every opportunity , and at the same time he carried on a complex and improved system of agriculture in Russia , and with extreme interest followed everything and knew everything that was being done in Russia .
They had lived just the life that to Levin seemed the ideal of perfection , and that he had dreamed of beginning with his wife , his family .
More than that , he did not know what to say , how to look , how to move .
&quot; Why , what is it ?
Although Levin was engrossed at the moment by his ideas about the problem of the land , he wondered , as he heard Sviazhsky : &quot; What is there inside of him ?
&quot; Though in their general features our laws on this subject are known to me , &quot; pursued Alexey Alexandrovitch , &quot; I should be glad to have an idea of the forms in which such things are done in practice . &quot; &quot; You would be glad , &quot; the lawyer , without lifting his eyes , responded , adopting , with a certain satisfaction , the tone of his client &apos;s remarks , &quot; for me to lay before you all the methods by which you could secure what you desire ? &quot; And on receiving an assuring nod from Alexey Alexandrovitch , he went on , stealing a glance now and then at Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s face , which was growing red in patches .
The mud was impassable along the roads ; two mills were carried away , and the weather got worse and worse .
As he always did in Petersburg , he left home not meaning to return till late at night .
But I know it &apos;s all on account of the other . &quot; &quot; Yes , but suppose she has refused Levin , and she wouldn &apos;t have refused him if it hadn &apos;t been for the other , I know .
&quot; I hope you will be there ? &quot; he said to Kitty .
In reality this &quot; of course , &quot; that seemed convincing to him , was simply the result of exactly the same circle of memories and images through which he had passed ten times already during the last hour - memories of happiness lost forever .
Well , I tell you what , &quot; he went on , flying off again to a subject quite beside the point , &quot; our district self @-@ government and all the rest of it - it &apos;s just like the birch branches we stick in the ground on Trinity Day , for instance , to look like a copse which has grown up of itself in Europe , and I can &apos;t gush over these birch branches and believe in them . &quot; Sergey Ivanovitch merely shrugged his shoulders , as though to express his wonder how the birch branches had come into their argument at that point , though he did really understand at once what his brother meant .
During the sacrament Levin did what he , an unbeliever , had done a thousand times .
What induced Darya Alexandrovna to tell me that ?
&quot; Your Rambouillet is in full conclave , &quot; he said , looking round at all the party ; &quot; the graces and the muses . &quot; But Princess Betsy could not endure that tone of his - &quot; sneering , &quot; as she called it , using the English word , and like a skillful hostess she at once brought him into a serious conversation on the subject of universal conscription .
&quot; Oh , yes , yes ; make haste , please , &quot; answered Levin , with difficulty restraining the smile of rapture which would overspread his face .
The laborers were obviously of the household : two were young men in cotton shirts and caps , the two others were hired laborers in homespun shirts , one an old man , the other a young fellow .
&quot; Bravo ! &quot; cried a voice .
&quot; Stay , take some sauce , &quot; he said , holding back Levin &apos;s hand as it pushed away the sauce .
The servant , whose turn it was to be up all night , lighted his candles , and would have gone away , but Levin stopped him .
But we may suspect it .
She was lying down , but hearing his steps she sat up hastily in her former attitude , and looked in a scared way at him .
and if so , where ?
This year the peasants were doing all the mowing for a third of the hay crop , and the village elder had come now to announce that the hay had been cut , and that , fearing rain , they had invited the counting @-@ house clerk over , had divided the crop in his presence , and had raked together eleven stacks as the owner &apos;s share .
&quot; Yes , and how that figure is done - what atmosphere !
She acknowledged this only by a slight nod , flushed a little , and frowned .
Stepan Arkadyevitch , like all unfaithful husbands indeed , was very solicitous for his wife &apos;s comfort , and he had himself looked over the house , and given instructions about everything that he considered necessary .
She saw in her the signs of that excitement of success she knew so well in herself ; she saw that she was intoxicated with the delighted admiration she was exciting .
Nimble children ran about the drying paths , covered with the prints of bare feet .
But she was wearing a dress that she knew suited her .
It was only from feeling himself nearer the ground and from the peculiar smoothness of his motion that Vronsky knew how greatly the mare had quickened her pace .
It &apos;s unnatural , too good , &quot; he said , kissing her hand .
What was he thinking of ?
The young wife worked easily , merrily , and dexterously .
I did nothing but begin and throw it aside .
Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s manner of walking , with a swing of the hips and flat feet , particularly annoyed Vronsky .
It was as though it were not he but the sharp scythe of itself swishing through the juicy grass .
We cut the whole meadow .
In order to keep his affairs in some sort of order , he used about five times a year ( more or less frequently , according to circumstances ) to shut himself up alone and put all his affairs into definite shape .
What struck Levin was that he could see through them all today , and from little , almost imperceptible signs knew the soul of each , and saw distinctly that they were all good at heart .
They may all know you are a scoundrel !
I know him .
She stood still and sobbed .
He opened his mouth to tell her she had behaved unbecomingly , but he could not help saying something utterly different .
&quot; It &apos;s out of the question , &quot; he said sternly .
&quot; Yes , but a man can &apos;t nurse a baby , &quot; said Pestsov , &quot; while a woman .... &quot; &quot; No , there was an Englishman who did suckle his baby on board ship , &quot; said the old prince , feeling this freedom in conversation permissible before his own daughters .
He was free from that shame , which had usually harassed him after a fall ; and he could look everyone straight in the face .
&quot; I didn &apos;t know you could skate , and skate so well . &quot; She looked at him earnestly , as though wishing to make out the cause of his confusion .
And again every detail of his quarrel with his wife was present to his imagination , all the hopelessness of his position , and worst of all , his own fault .
At first Anna sincerely believed that she was displeased with him for daring to pursue her .
&quot; Do you know what the result of that would be ?
I know that my husband &apos;s brother is dying and my husband is going to him , and I go with my husband too .... &quot; &quot; Kitty !
&quot; It seems so to me sometimes .
One was very unpleasant , from a merchant who was buying a forest on his wife &apos;s property .
&quot; Here &apos;s a delightful visitor !
&quot; Are the oysters good ?
Alexey Alexandrovitch got into his carriage , and buried himself in it so as neither to see nor be seen .
&quot; He has been making me laugh so . &quot; &quot; Well , _ bonne chance _ ! &quot; she added , giving Vronsky one finger of the hand in which she held her fan , and with a shrug of her shoulders she twitched down the bodice of her gown that had worked up , so as to be duly naked as she moved forward towards the footlights into the light of the gas , and the sight of all eyes .
Mihail Vassilievitch Sludin , the chief secretary , was a straightforward , intelligent , good @-@ hearted , and conscientious man , and Alexey Alexandrovitch was aware of his personal goodwill .
&quot; I used to know her husband , and her too a little , before she &apos;d joined the Pietists . &quot; &quot; What is a Pietist , papa ? &quot; asked Kitty , dismayed to find that what she prized so highly in Madame Stahl had a name .
Precisely at five o &apos;clock , before the bronze Peter the First clock had struck the fifth stroke , Alexey Alexandrovitch came in , wearing a white tie and evening coat with two stars , as he had to go out directly after dinner .
&quot; If he hadn &apos;t been going away , I could have understood your answer and his too .
Let him and Alexey Alexandrovitch tilt at each other in the committee - that &apos;s no affair of ours .
You must have pity , sir , on the children .
&quot; But the humiliation , &quot; said Kitty , &quot; the humiliation one can never forget , can never forget , &quot; she said , remembering her look at the last ball during the pause in the music .
She always cared for him . &quot; &quot; Well , we shall see which of them will step on the rug first .
&quot; But I saw her and forgave her .
And you cannot thank me .
This piece of news irritated Levin .
&quot; Because I am beginning an action for divorce against your sister , my wife .
Worst of all , the energy expended on this work was not simply wasted .
&quot; Still I haven &apos;t the one thing of most importance for that , &quot; he answered ; &quot; I haven &apos;t the desire for power .
On seeing the sick man , she pitied him .
&quot; Tell him to send me a doctor . &quot; Three more days of agony followed ; the sick man was still in the same condition .
Kitty said not a word of that ; she talked of nothing but her spiritual condition .
Vronsky did not speak ; his handsome face was serious , but perfectly composed .
The Englishman puckered up his lips , intending to indicate a smile that anyone should verify his saddling .
&quot; Impossible ! &quot; he cried , letting down the pedal of the washing basin in which he had been sousing his healthy red neck .
&quot; You are loathsome to me , repulsive ! &quot; she shrieked , getting more and more heated .
Kitty smiled here too , at the ball , when she glanced at it in the glass .
To his misery he felt that he was whole and unhurt .
Been here long ?
That &apos;s the only favor I ask of my gracious brothers . - Nikolay Levin . &quot; Levin read it , and without raising his head stood with the note in his hands opposite Sergey Ivanovitch .
He knew it was the voice of the lady he had met at the door .
How nice it is ! &quot; he took her hand and drew it towards his lips , but as though afraid she would dislike it he changed his mind , let it go , and only stroked it .
The hostess sat down at the table and took off her gloves .
&quot; Couldn &apos;t you take your son , and still leave him ? &quot; &quot; Yes ; but it all depends on him .
Before Vronsky and Oblonsky came back the ladies heard the facts from the butler .
&quot; That you &apos;ve no pride , no dignity ; that you &apos;re disgracing , ruining your daughter by this vulgar , stupid matchmaking ! &quot; &quot; But , really , for mercy &apos;s sake , prince , what have I done ? &quot; said the princess , almost crying .
And Varenka went after them .
&quot; To be sure we shall ! &quot; said Nikitin .
And to do this one must lower the standard of husbandry and interest the laborers in its success .
Good @-@ bye , countess . &quot; &quot; Good @-@ bye , my love , &quot; answered the countess .
The excitement of the approaching race gained upon him as he drove further and further into the atmosphere of the races , overtaking carriages driving up from the summer villas or out of Petersburg .
He walked gloomily , frowning and coughing .
She came to the rescue before anyone ; she took the man by the arm and led him away . &quot; &quot; There , mamma , &quot; said Kitty ; &quot; you wonder that I &apos;m enthusiastic about her . &quot; The next day , as she watched her unknown friend , Kitty noticed that Mademoiselle Varenka was already on the same terms with Levin and his companion as with her other _ protégés _ .
The very same thing , don &apos;t you see , may be looked at tragically , and turned into a misery , or it may be looked at simply and even humorously .
Wait a bit !
He scanned the bookcases and bookshelves , and with the same dubious air with which he had regarded the snipe , he smiled contemptuously and shook his head disapprovingly , as though by no means willing to allow that this game were worth the candle .
Kitty was on her knees before her .
And now ?
I was up home ; an old man up there has sown wheat too , about an acre of it .
&quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch !
He &apos;ll pull the tooth out for you so gently , you won &apos;t notice it . &quot; Standing at the first litany , Levin attempted to revive in himself his youthful recollections of the intense religious emotion he had passed through between the ages of sixteen and seventeen .
I have a loathing for fallen women .
No one would give more . &quot; &quot; Then you &apos;ve as good as given away your forest for nothing , &quot; said Levin gloomily .
Vronsky slipped his finger under the saddle @-@ girth .
She sent for the doctor , sent to the chemist &apos;s , set the maid who had come with her and Marya Nikolaevna to sweep and dust and scrub ; she herself washed up something , washed out something else , laid something under the quilt .
Wait a bit , wait a bit !
Levin noticed , indeed , that all that day the patient pulled at himself , as it were , trying to snatch something away .
Capital , we &apos;ll drive over . &quot; &quot; I shall be delighted , &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch , still smiling .
&quot; Can I have missed it ? &quot; shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch , who could not see for the smoke .
I only know that she thanks God for everything , for every misfortune , and thanks God too that her husband died .
He sat down again , waiting for other visitors to arrive , in order to retreat unnoticed .
&quot; The only question is on what terms you agree to give her a divorce .
As soon as she began to cry the prince too calmed down .
My decision is as follows .
&quot; Oh , yes , &quot; he said .
Kitty meanwhile had long ago been quite ready , and in her white dress and long veil and wreath of orange blossoms she was standing in the drawing @-@ room of the Shtcherbatskys &quot; house with her sister , Madame Lvova , who was her bridal @-@ mother .
&quot; No , &quot; said Kitty , blushing , but looking at him all the more boldly with her truthful eyes ; &quot; a girl may be so circumstanced that she cannot live in the family without humiliation , while she herself .... &quot; At the hint he understood her .
Vronsky passed Mahotin , but he was immediately aware of him close upon him , and he never ceased hearing the even @-@ thudding hoofs and the rapid and still quite fresh breathing of Gladiator .
He would have had his hand chopped off before he would have allowed himself by a word , by a hint , to humiliate her , or even to fall short of the fullest respect a woman could look for .
Annushka was already dozing , the red bag on her lap , clutched by her broad hands , in gloves , of which one was torn .
&quot; Nothing but ambition , nothing but the desire to get on , that &apos;s all there is in his soul , &quot; she thought ; &quot; as for these lofty ideals , love of culture , religion , they are only so many tools for getting on . &quot; From his glances towards the ladies &quot; pavilion ( he was staring straight at her , but did not distinguish his wife in the sea of muslin , ribbons , feathers , parasols and flowers ) she saw that he was looking for her , but she purposely avoided noticing him .
When Levin had abruptly departed , the princess was delighted , and said to her husband triumphantly : &quot; You see I was right . &quot; When Vronsky appeared on the scene , she was still more delighted , confirmed in her opinion that Kitty was to make not simply a good , but a brilliant match .
Alexey Alexandrovitch was in principle in favor of the publicity of legal proceedings , though for some higher official considerations he disliked the application of the principle in Russia , and disapproved of it , as far as he could disapprove of anything instituted by authority of the Emperor .
She and Levin had a conversation of their own , yet not a conversation , but some sort of mysterious communication , which brought them every moment nearer , and stirred in both a sense of glad terror before the unknown into which they were entering .
The government obviously is guided by abstract considerations , and remains indifferent to the influence its measures may exercise .
I am Konstantin Levin , and nothing else . &quot; &quot; And Konstantin Levin very much out of temper , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , smiling .
If it &apos;s a good thing for you , it &apos;s a good thing for everyone . &quot; Konstantin Levin felt himself morally pinned against a wall , and so he got hot , and unconsciously blurted out the chief cause of his indifference to public business .
Of course you couldn &apos;t come .
It made his blood run cold when he began to think of all these details .
How can you think it a matter of no importance whether the peasant , whom you love as you assert .... &quot; &quot; I never did assert it , &quot; thought Konstantin Levin .
I have forgiven it , and you ought to forgive ! &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch heard her , but her words had no effect on him now .
He did not believe that his picture was better than all the pictures of Raphael , but he knew that what he tried to convey in that picture , no one ever had conveyed .
The end was expected every minute .
Dear friend ! &quot; she went on , warmly squeezing his hand in both of hers and gazing with her fine pensive eyes into his .
But her happiness was poisoned by doubts .
The idea of seeking help in her difficulty in religion was as remote from her as seeking help from Alexey Alexandrovitch himself , although she had never had doubts of the faith in which she had been brought up .
&quot; It &apos;s an impossible position .
Only at rare moments , when the opium gave him an instant &apos;s relief from the never @-@ ceasing pain , he would sometimes , half asleep , utter what was ever more intense in his heart than in all the others : &quot; Oh , if it were only the end ! &quot; or : &quot; When will it be over ? &quot; His sufferings , steadily growing more intense , did their work and prepared him for death .
Could one , with any feeling , live as he is living with me ?
( This was the money Sergey Ivanovitch had paid . )
&quot; Come round ? &quot; &quot; Yes , sir . &quot; &quot; Do you think so ?
Do stay a little . &quot; Levin stayed to tea ; but his good @-@ humor had vanished , and he felt ill at ease .
He had said he would fetch his wife , but now , taking stock of the emotion he was feeling , he decided that he would try on the contrary to persuade her not to go in to the sick man .
Whatever faults Levin had , there was not a trace of hypocrisy in him , and so the children showed him the same friendliness that they saw in their mother &apos;s face .
Levin often put his views before her in all their complexity , and not uncommonly he argued with her and did not agree with her comments .
What has to be cured is what makes him poor . &quot; &quot; Well , in that , at least , you &apos;re in agreement with Spencer , whom you dislike so much .
Answering inquiries about the disposition of Anna Arkadyevna &apos;s rooms and belongings , he had exercised immense self @-@ control to appear like a man in whose eyes what had occurred was not unforeseen nor out of the ordinary course of events , and he attained his aim : no one could have detected in him signs of despair .
Look you where I sowed last spring .
&quot; I must say and express fully the following points : first , exposition of the value to be attached to public opinion and to decorum ; secondly , exposition of religious significance of marriage ; thirdly , if need be , reference to the calamity possibly ensuing to our son ; fourthly , reference to the unhappiness likely to result to herself . &quot; And , interlacing his fingers , Alexey Alexandrovitch stretched them , and the joints of the fingers cracked .
And at the same time this is the simplest and most certain method . &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch fully understood now .
Behind the tender , setting the platform more and more slowly swaying , came the luggage van with a dog whining in it .
The Countess Nordston and Levin got into that relation with one another not seldom seen in society , when two persons , who remain externally on friendly terms , despise each other to such a degree that they cannot even take each other seriously , and cannot even be offended by each other .
Vronsky glanced at them , frowned , and looking down at his book as though he had not noticed them , he proceeded to eat and read at the same time .
The visitors , not agreeably impressed beforehand by Golenishtchev &apos;s account of the artist , were still less so by his personal appearance .
&quot; Sh ... it &apos;s flying ! &quot; The shrill whistles rapidly following one another were heard again .
The terrible new head turned out to be an extremely amenable person , and Stepan Arkadyevitch lunched with him and stayed on , so that it was four o &apos;clock before he got to Alexey Alexandrovitch .
She must be calm , and get out of this insufferable position .
The condition of the native tribes was investigated in its political , administrative , economic , ethnographic , material , and religious aspects .
From the vague answers to his question how much hay had been cut on the principal meadow , from the hurry of the village elder who had made the division , not asking leave , from the whole tone of the peasant , Levin perceived that there was something wrong in the division of the hay , and made up his mind to drive over himself to look into the matter .
&quot; Oh !
Does that offend you ? &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch shivered , and bent his hands to make the joints crack .
But he could do nothing , and had to lie and look on and listen .
In the middle of the mazurka , repeating a complicated figure , newly invented by Korsunsky , Anna came forward into the center of the circle , chose two gentlemen , and summoned a lady and Kitty .
But , on the other hand , directly she thought of the future with Vronsky , there arose before her a perspective of brilliant happiness ; with Levin the future seemed misty .
It &apos;s hard work at first , but you get into it .
Vronsky looked at Levin and Countess Nordston , and smiled .
Again she would have moved away .
&quot; Is Katya not here ? &quot; he gasped , looking round while Levin reluctantly assented to the doctor &apos;s words .
I have done everything for this woman , and she has trodden it all in the mud to which she is akin .
From the thickest parts of the copse , where the snow still remained , came the faint sound of narrow winding threads of water running away .
&quot; What am I coming for ? &quot; he repeated , looking straight into her eyes .
We are acquainted , I believe , &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch indifferently , giving his hand .
&quot; What , what is it you want to make me feel , eh ? &quot; said Kitty quickly .
&quot; I &apos;ve just been seeing him , and he &apos;s really a capital fellow .
And here this letter regarded them as unspoken , and gave her what she had wanted .
We are very well content , sir , as it is . &quot; Levin got on his horse and rode towards the field where was last year &apos;s clover , and the one which was ploughed ready for the spring corn .
&quot; Tell him or not tell him ? &quot; she thought , looking into his quiet , affectionate eyes .
After spending two months in Moscow in a state of enchantment , seeing Kitty almost every day in society , into which he went so as to meet her , he abruptly decided that it could not be , and went back to the country .
Twice she uttered her usual cuckoo call , and then gave a hoarse , hurried call and broke down .
On reaching home Alexey Alexandrovitch went to his study , as he usually did , seated himself in his low chair , opened a book on the Papacy at the place where he had laid the paper @-@ knife in it , and read till one o &apos;clock , just as he usually did .
&quot; He came today , mamma . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s one thing I want to say .... &quot; began the princess , and from her serious and alert face , Kitty guessed what it would be .
The shirt worn since the morning was crumpled and out of the question with the fashionable open waistcoat .
Hypocrisy in anything whatever may deceive the cleverest and most penetrating man , but the least wide @-@ awake of children recognizes it , and is revolted by it , however ingeniously it may be disguised .
All attention was turned upon him .
He squared his chest , took out a cigarette , took two whiffs at it , flung it into a mother @-@ of @-@ pearl ashtray , and with rapid steps walked through the drawing @-@ room , and opened the other door into his wife &apos;s bedroom .
&quot; Dolly , dear , &quot; she said , &quot; I don &apos;t want to speak for him to you , nor to try to comfort you ; that &apos;s impossible .
He longed for food and for sleep .
Our love , if it could be stronger , will be strengthened by there being something terrible in it , &quot; he said , lifting his head and parting his strong teeth in a smile .
&quot; And , after all , Anna is in no wise to blame , &quot; thought Dolly .
What exaggeration could there be in the practice of a doctrine wherein one was bidden to turn the other cheek when one was smitten , and give one &apos;s cloak if one &apos;s coat were taken ?
&quot; Darya Alexandrovna told me to inform you that she is going away .
I must !
&quot; Anything &apos;s better than the position in which you &apos;re living .
For the few seconds during which the visitors were gazing at the picture in silence Mihailov too gazed at it with the indifferent eye of an outsider .
Her face was hidden by a veil , but he drank in with glad eyes the special movement in walking , peculiar to her alone , the slope of the shoulders , and the setting of the head , and at once a sort of electric shock ran all over him .
But she was in the middle stage between these two ; she was excited , and at the same time she had sufficient self @-@ possession to be able to observe .
Beyond the stream was heard the cuckoo .
These pinpricks have stabbed me to the heart , and I have not the strength to bear it .
And he said to himself again in the dining @-@ room , &quot; Yes , I must decide and put a stop to it , and express my view of it .... &quot; And again at the turn in the drawing @-@ room he asked himself , &quot; Decide how ? &quot; And again he asked himself , &quot; What had occurred ? &quot; and answered , &quot; Nothing , &quot; and recollected that jealousy was a feeling insulting to his wife ; but again in the drawing @-@ room he was convinced that something had happened .
All these traces of his life seemed to clutch him , and to say to him : &quot; No , you &apos;re not going to get away from us , and you &apos;re not going to be different , but you &apos;re going to be the same as you &apos;ve always been ; with doubts , everlasting dissatisfaction with yourself , vain efforts to amend , and falls , and everlasting expectation , of a happiness which you won &apos;t get , and which isn &apos;t possible for you . &quot; This the things said to him , but another voice in his heart was telling him that he must not fall under the sway of the past , and that one can do anything with oneself .
&quot; Well , have you brought the money ? &quot; asked Oblonsky .
&quot; There &apos;s one other thing I ought to tell you .
&quot; Blessed is the name of our God , from the beginning , is now , and ever shall be , &quot; the little old priest answered in a submissive , piping voice , still fingering something at the lectern .
I shall be there at six o &apos;clock . &quot; She sealed it up , and , Betsy coming back , in her presence handed the note to be taken .
Korney , perceiving his master &apos;s emotion , asked the clerk to call another time .
A wretched Russian nag they &apos;ll ruin , but keep good dray @-@ horses - they won &apos;t ruin them .
And what was this inevitable death - he did not know , had never thought about it , and what was more , had not the power , had not the courage to think about it .
&quot; If I look at him he will think I am studying him , I am afraid ; if I don &apos;t look at him , he &apos;ll think I &apos;m thinking of other things .
I can &apos;t act except from the heart , and you act from principle .
Vronsky too was getting up , and in a stooping , not yet erect posture , looked up at him from under his brows .
&quot; Has your master come ? &quot; he asked a gardener .
&quot; Here &apos;s Yashvin ordering me to drink a pick @-@ me @-@ up . &quot; &quot; Well , you did give it to us yesterday , &quot; said one of those who had come in ; &quot; you didn &apos;t let us get a wink of sleep all night . &quot; &quot; Oh , didn &apos;t we make a pretty finish ! &quot; said Petritsky .
And not for my sake - I see that you suffer . &quot; &quot; Yes , run away , and become your mistress , &quot; she said angrily .
But this evening , instead of his usual thoughts and meditations upon official details , his thoughts were absorbed by his wife and something disagreeable connected with her .
When Levin took over the management of the estate , he thought on examining the grasslands that they were worth more , and he fixed the price at twenty @-@ five roubles the three acres .
&quot; To enter into all the details of your feelings I have no right , and besides , I regard that as useless and even harmful , &quot; began Alexey Alexandrovitch .
&quot; Why not ? &quot; said Nikolay Levin , now turning with exasperation upon Kritsky .
His sister @-@ in @-@ law , a young girl Levin liked very much , lived in his house ; and Levin knew that Sviazhsky and his wife would have greatly liked to marry the girl to him .
&quot; Press more on the heel , &quot; said another .
She went into the dining @-@ room on the pretext of giving some directions , and spoke loudly on purpose , expecting him to come out there ; but he did not come , though she heard him go to the door of his study as he parted from the chief secretary .
Everything clever is so stale .... &quot; &quot; That has been said long ago , &quot; the ambassador &apos;s wife interrupted him , laughing .
&quot; Mamma ?
Tant mieux , mon cher , tant mieux . _ &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what you are referring to , maman , &quot; he answered coldly .
There &apos;s something strange about her , &quot; said her friend .
The whole point is whether you love him now or not , &quot; said Varenka , who called everything by its name .
Alexey Alexandrovitch was aware of the truth of this .
I &apos;ll tell you what ! &quot; shouted the prince , waving his arms , and at once wrapping his squirrel @-@ lined dressing @-@ gown round him again .
He knew that she had a husband , but had hardly believed in his existence , and only now fully believed in him , with his head and shoulders , and his legs clad in black trousers ; especially when he saw this husband calmly take her arm with a sense of property .
And that &apos;s what I felt when I was married .
that &apos;s Madame Karenina , &quot; said Vronsky .
Stepan Arkadyevitch took him by the arm and led him away to Karenin .
&quot; But what do you say to Claire today ?
It may be a Utopia .
Haven &apos;t I striven , striven with all my strength , to find something to give meaning to my life ?
But I do mind seeing the process of impoverishment from a sort of - I don &apos;t know what to call it - innocence .
To legitimize the child , to compromise me , and prevent a divorce , &quot; he thought .
On Thursday the wind dropped , and a thick gray fog brooded over the land as though hiding the mysteries of the transformations that were being wrought in nature .
It seemed to him that he was the first who had discovered this pleasure , and he was enjoying his discovery .
&quot; Do you know , Anna , my youth and my beauty are gone , taken by whom ?
But these unpleasant matters were all drowned in the sea of kindliness and good humor which was always within him , and more so than ever since his course of Carlsbad waters .
To sell this forest was absolutely essential ; but at present , until he was reconciled with his wife , the subject could not be discussed .
And suddenly there floated into his mind the joyful thought : &quot; In two years &quot; time I shall have two Dutch cows ; Pava herself will perhaps still be alive , a dozen young daughters of Berkoot and the three others - how lovely ! &quot; He took up his book again .
All of it had had meaning before , but now there was no reality in it .
Why a locksmiths &quot; association in a village ? &quot; &quot; Why ?
Quite the contrary ; a child can kill a bear , &quot; he said , with a slight bow moving aside for the ladies , who were approaching the table .
More women came on the scene from somewhere , young and handsome , middle @-@ aged , old and ugly , with children and without children .
Indeed I feel sure .... &quot; &quot; Why should you think that ? &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , smiling at his excitement .
When ?
Levin , who had long been possessed by the idea of reconciling his brothers , at least in face of death , had written to his brother , Sergey Ivanovitch , and having received an answer from him , he read this letter to the sick man .
I &apos;ve been waiting in agony for an hour , two hours ... No , I won &apos;t ...
But Levin overtook her .
Do you know Vronsky ? &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch asked Levin .
&quot; Kitty , it &apos;s cold !
&quot; Of what ? &quot; She looked at him so simply , so brightly , that anyone who did not know her as her husband knew her could not have noticed anything unnatural , either in the sound or the sense of her words .
Rows of carriages , sledges , drivers , and policemen were standing in the approach .
&quot; All right , but do sit down . &quot; But Levin could not sit down .
&quot; Very well , then , give us that brand with the oysters , and then we &apos;ll see . &quot; &quot; Yes , sir .
Writing out on note paper in his minute hand all that he owed , he added up the amount and found that his debts amounted to seventeen thousand and some odd hundreds , which he left out for the sake of clearness .
Give us the seltzer water and lemon . &quot; &quot; Vronsky ! &quot; shouted someone when he was already outside .
But if you are conscious yourself of even the smallest foundation for them , then I beg you to think a little , and if your heart prompts you , to speak out to me .... &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch was unconsciously saying something utterly unlike what he had prepared .
She caught sight of her husband in the distance .
Stremov drew back , affecting to have blindly followed Karenin , and to be astounded and distressed at what had been done .
&quot; Matvey , my sister Anna Arkadyevna will be here tomorrow , &quot; he said , checking for a minute the sleek , plump hand of the barber , cutting a pink path through his long , curly whiskers .
To Sergey Ivanovitch the country was particularly good , because there it was possible and fitting to do nothing .
It was only when Anna had left his house , and the English governess sent to ask him whether she should dine with him or separately , that for the first time he clearly comprehended his position , and was appalled by it .
Anna heard his high , measured tones , not losing one word , and every word struck her as false , and stabbed her ears with pain .
&quot; Delighted that you &apos;ve come .
Stepan Arkadyevitch saw by his face that he had come simply to keep his promise , and was performing a disagreeable duty in being present at this gathering .
With inaudible steps she went quickly to the sick man &apos;s bedside , and going up so that he had not to turn his head , she immediately clasped in her fresh young hand the skeleton of his huge hand , pressed it , and began speaking with that soft eagerness , sympathetic and not jarring , which is peculiar to women .
Those details Vronsky learned later ; at the moment all he saw was that just under him , where Frou @-@ Frou must alight , Diana &apos;s legs or head might be in the way .
Directly after the doctor , who had taken up so much time , came the celebrated traveler , and Alexey Alexandrovitch , by means of the pamphlet he had only just finished reading and his previous acquaintance with the subject , impressed the traveler by the depth of his knowledge of the subject and the breadth and enlightenment of his view of it .
Just as the particle of water in frost , definitely and unalterably , takes the special form of the crystal of snow , so each new person that arrived at the springs was at once placed in his special place .
&quot; And just now , I am impatiently awaiting my mother &apos;s arrival from Petersburg , as peculiarly fortunate , &quot; he told her .
Mercy on us , the senselessness in the world ! &quot; he cried suddenly .
And , strange to say , he felt utterly cold , and was not conscious of sorrow nor of loss , less still of pity for his brother .
Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced at it .
But let us take Ivanov .
And with fury , as it were with passion , the murderer falls on the body , and drags it and hacks at it ; so he covered her face and shoulders with kisses .
&quot; Then let me change your bandages . &quot; In silence , stiffening his broad jaws , he looked at her while she bandaged him up .
But immediately she thought of the man for whom she had given him up .
She felt certain that her surmises were correct ; that Kitty &apos;s misery , her inconsolable misery , was due precisely to the fact that Levin had made her an offer and she had refused him , and Vronsky had deceived her , and that she was fully prepared to love Levin and to detest Vronsky .
But the position of a man pursuing a married woman , and , regardless of everything , staking his life on drawing her into adultery , has something fine and grand about it , and can never be ridiculous ; and so it was with a proud and gay smile under his mustaches that he lowered the opera @-@ glass and looked at his cousin .
&quot; Kitty , you &apos;re not dancing the mazurka ? &quot; &quot; No , no , &quot; said Kitty in a voice shaking with tears .
She was not like a girl at her first ball , for whom all faces in the ballroom melt into one vision of fairyland .
To regain her serenity completely she went into the nursery , and spent the whole evening with her son , put him to bed herself , signed him with the cross , and tucked him up .
Moreover ( Levin felt that the irascible landowner had been right ) the peasants made their first and unalterable condition of any agreement whatever that they should not be forced to any new methods of tillage of any kind , nor to use new implements .
No one can possibly say anything new about her , &quot; said a fat , red @-@ faced , flaxen @-@ headed lady , without eyebrows and chignon , wearing an old silk dress .
And it was not the necessity of concealment , not the aim with which the concealment was contrived , but the process of concealment itself which attracted her .
But now at the first instant of meeting him , she was seized by a feeling of joyful pride .
Vronsky had told Kitty that both he and his brother were so used to obeying their mother that they never made up their minds to any important undertaking without consulting her .
And I know many such .
They criticized the people they were expecting , and the conversation fell upon Liza Merkalova .
Kitty had repeated this without attaching any significance to the words .
And all the way from the old peasant &apos;s to Sviazhsky &apos;s he kept recalling this peasant farm as though there were something in this impression that demanded his special attention .
&quot; Well , _ au revoir _ , then !
&quot; If you can forgive me , forgive me , &quot; said her eyes , &quot; I am so happy . &quot; &quot; I hate them all , and you , and myself , &quot; his eyes responded , and he took up his hat .
But at that moment a ring was heard .
Our difference of opinion amounts to this , that you make the mainspring self @-@ interest , while I suppose that interest in the common weal is bound to exist in every man of a certain degree of advancement .
&quot; Rhine wine , please , &quot; said the young officer , stealing a timid glance at Vronsky , and trying to pull his scarcely visible mustache .
He had not in the least expected what he saw and felt in his brother &apos;s room .
Sometimes for half an hour at a stretch he would sit silently gazing at the saffron @-@ red , downy , wrinkled face of the sleeping baby , watching the movements of the frowning brows , and the fat little hands , with clenched fingers , that rubbed the little eyes and nose .
&quot; What do you want of me ? &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch paused , and rubbed his forehead and his eyes .
Yes , you &apos;re a wonderful husband ! &quot; she said , with a meaning and affable air , as though she were bestowing an order of magnanimity on him for his conduct to his wife .
&quot; She is crushed , simply crushed by your generosity .
In Him alone we find peace , consolation , salvation , and love , &quot; she said , and turning her eyes heavenwards , she began praying , as Alexey Alexandrovitch gathered from her silence .
The bailiff said that he had said so a long while ago , but no heed had been paid him .
Two childish voices ( Stepan Arkadyevitch recognized the voices of Grisha , his youngest boy , and Tanya , his eldest girl ) were heard outside the door .
&quot; I imagine you at the ball in lilac . &quot; &quot; And why in lilac precisely ? &quot; asked Anna , smiling .
&quot; Go into my study ; you can talk there . &quot; &quot; Quite so , where you please , &quot; said Ryabinin with contemptuous dignity , as though wishing to make it felt that others might be in difficulties as to how to behave , but that he could never be in any difficulty about anything .
&quot; Let us go , let us go ! &quot; she said .
&quot; Why weren &apos;t you at the races yesterday ?
One must value old friends . &quot; Levin did not like these words of Darya Alexandrovna &apos;s .
She had often , almost always , to be pretending now .
Now I understand , I understand it all , I see it all ! &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s wrinkled face wore an expression of agony ; he took her by the hand and tried to say something , but he could not utter it ; his lower lip quivered , but he still went on struggling with his emotion , and only now and then glanced at her .
He had resolved from the first to tell her two things - that he was not chaste as she was , and that he was not a believer .
&quot; I tell you that &apos;s not the point - I can &apos;t doubt that ; but see what he writes to me .
So one advances them a third , but one says : &quot; Remember , lads , I have helped you , and you must help me when I need it - whether it &apos;s the sowing of the oats , or the haycutting , or the harvest &quot; ; and well , one agrees , so much for each taxpayer - though there are dishonest ones among them too , it &apos;s true . &quot; Levin , who had long been familiar with these patriarchal methods , exchanged glances with Sviazhsky and interrupted Mihail Petrovitch , turning again to the gentleman with the gray whiskers .
Stepan Arkadyevitch liked dining , but still better he liked to give a dinner , small , but very choice , both as regards the food and drink and as regards the selection of guests .
But this I &apos;ve said , and I say still , that if my share had been given me when I needed it , my whole life would have been different . &quot; Konstantin made haste to change the conversation .
&quot; Of course I won &apos;t , but it would have been better .... &quot; And he smiled gloomily .
You were probably only just awake .
But he went closer , saw the face , and doubt became impossible .
It was her solitary refuge from the household cares which crowded upon her directly she went out from it .
We both know him .
They say he &apos;s so religious , so high @-@ principled , so upright , so clever ; but they don &apos;t see what I &apos;ve seen .
This was Varenka .
&quot; Well , is she cheerful ? &quot; The little girl knew that there was a quarrel between her father and mother , and that her mother could not be cheerful , and that her father must be aware of this , and that he was pretending when he asked about it so lightly .
Of these people the one that attracted her most was a Russian girl who had come to the watering @-@ place with an invalid Russian lady , Madame Stahl , as everyone called her .
&quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch , &quot; she said , looking at him and not dropping her eyes under his persistent gaze at her hair , &quot; I &apos;m a guilty woman , I &apos;m a bad woman , but I am the same as I was , as I told you then , and I have come to tell you that I can change nothing . &quot; &quot; I have asked you no question about that , &quot; he said , all at once , resolutely and with hatred looking her straight in the face ; &quot; that was as I had supposed . &quot; Under the influence of anger he apparently regained complete possession of all his faculties .
&quot; Oh , why didn &apos;t I die !
&quot; &quot; Joinest together in love them that were separate . &quot; What deep meaning in those words , and how they correspond with what one feels at this moment , &quot; thought Levin .
&quot; Dear friend ! &quot; repeated Countess Lidia Ivanovna , never taking her eyes off his , and suddenly her eyebrows rose at the inner corners , describing a triangle on her forehead , her ugly yellow face became still uglier , but Alexey Alexandrovitch felt that she was sorry for him and was preparing to cry .
&quot; I should think it must be dull in the winter . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not dull if one has work to do ; besides , one &apos;s not dull by oneself , &quot; Levin replied abruptly .
&quot; But tonight it &apos;s impossible , &quot; answered Korsunsky .
In her memories of Vronsky there always entered a certain element of awkwardness , though he was in the highest degree well @-@ bred and at ease , as though there were some false note - not in Vronsky , he was very simple and nice , but in herself , while with Levin she felt perfectly simple and clear .
I understand !
He was a gentleman - that was true , and Vronsky could not deny it .
She did not give up everything she had learned , but she became aware that she had deceived herself in supposing she could be what she wanted to be .
The priest lighted two candles , wreathed with flowers , and holding them sideways so that the wax dropped slowly from them he turned , facing the bridal pair .
This position of affairs had now lasted three days , and not only the husband and wife themselves , but all the members of their family and household , were painfully conscious of it .
And some people said that Madame Stahl had made her social position as a philanthropic , highly religious woman ; other people said she really was at heart the highly ethical being , living for nothing but the good of her fellow creatures , which she represented herself to be .
&quot; The princess helps to make balls happy and successful .
Who &apos;s here ? &quot; asked Levin , unable to help blushing , as he knocked the snow off his cap with his glove .
She knew that the old lady was expected from day to day , that she would be pleased at her son &apos;s choice , and she felt it strange that he should not make his offer through fear of vexing his mother .
&quot; I shall lie down soon enough , &quot; he pronounced slowly , &quot; when I &apos;m dead , &quot; he said sarcastically , wrathfully .
One of two things : either let him take her away , act with energy , or give her a divorce .
The whole ball up to the last quadrille was for Kitty an enchanted vision of delightful colors , sounds , and motions .
And what table wine ? &quot; &quot; You can give us Nuits .
And I should like you better still , if I had time , &quot; answered the eyes of the unknown girl .
But now , just because it was terrible , because people broke their necks , and there was a doctor standing at each obstacle , and an ambulance with a cross on it , and a sister of mercy , he had made up his mind to take part in the race .
It was for her sake I went through that farce .
But now she began to feel pleasure and interest in dress again .
General principles , as to the cow being a machine for the production of milk , she looked on with suspicion .
Can it be there &apos;s no chance of it ? &quot; he murmured with his lips ; but she heard .
All her illness and treatment struck her as a thing so stupid , ludicrous even !
I can &apos;t quarrel with you .
&quot; You may trample me in the mud , &quot; he heard Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s words and saw him standing before him , and saw Anna &apos;s face with its burning flush and glittering eyes , gazing with love and tenderness not at him but at Alexey Alexandrovitch ; he saw his own , as he fancied , foolish and ludicrous figure when Alexey Alexandrovitch took his hands away from his face .
She disliked in Levin his strange and uncompromising opinions and his shyness in society , founded , as she supposed , on his pride and his queer sort of life , as she considered it , absorbed in cattle and peasants .
&quot; Let us never speak of it , &quot; she added more calmly .
But Konstantin Levin wanted to justify himself for the failing , of which he was conscious , of lack of zeal for the public welfare , and he went on .
&quot; I don &apos;t believe it , I don &apos;t believe it , I can &apos;t believe it ! &quot; Dolly said , clasping her bony hands before her with a vigorous gesture .
There was in her the glow of the real diamond among glass imitations .
&quot; What elegance !
Chapter 11 In the middle of July the elder of the village on Levin &apos;s sister &apos;s estate , about fifteen miles from Pokrovskoe , came to Levin to report on how things were going there and on the hay .
And he himself , and Golenishtchev , and still more Anna , thought it very good , because it was far more like the celebrated pictures they knew than Mihailov &apos;s picture .
Levin had come across the magazine articles about which they were disputing , and had read them , interested in them as a development of the first principles of science , familiar to him as a natural science student at the university .
From Varenka &apos;s accounts of the doings of Madame Stahl and other people whom she mentioned , Kitty had already constructed the plan of her own future life .
&quot; I think unceasingly of the same thing .
She vividly recalled his manly , resolute face , his noble self @-@ possession , and the good nature conspicuous in everything towards everyone .
The Shtcherbatskys made the acquaintance too of the family of an English Lady Somebody , and of a German countess and her son , wounded in the last war , and of a learned Swede , and of M. Canut and his sister .
&quot; Yes , it &apos;s better so , &quot; she said , tightly gripping his hand .
And , as though answering his thought , the priest said to him : &quot; You are about to enter into holy matrimony , and God may bless you with offspring .
&quot; Do try , now , and put yourself in my place , take the point of view of a country person .
&quot; Go to her , sir ; own your fault again .
Old Laska , who had not yet fully digested her delight at his return , and had run out into the yard to bark , came back wagging her tail , and crept up to him , bringing in the scent of fresh air , put her head under his hand , and whined plaintively , asking to be stroked .
If any did so , he was ready to force all who might speak to be silent and to respect the non @-@ existent honor of the woman he loved .
I positively forgot it ... I &apos;ve brought you a visitor .
The children were not only beautiful to look at in their smart little dresses , but they were charming in the way they behaved .
&quot; That &apos;s it , Alexey , &quot; said the captain , in his loud baritone .
Then all of a sudden , on Easter Monday , a warm wind sprang up , storm clouds swooped down , and for three days and three nights the warm , driving rain fell in streams .
&quot; You wouldn &apos;t believe , &quot; he would say to his brother , &quot; what a pleasure this rural laziness is to me .
Forty paces from him a carriage with four horses harnessed abreast was driving towards him along the grassy road on which he was walking .
He saw that she was behaving unbecomingly , and considered it his duty to tell her so .
She jumped up , and began walking about .
&quot; Where are you off to ? &quot; &quot; I must go to Peterhof . &quot; &quot; Has the mare come from Tsarskoe ? &quot; &quot; Yes , but I &apos;ve not seen her yet . &quot; &quot; They say Mahotin &apos;s Gladiator &apos;s lame . &quot; &quot; Nonsense !
&quot; I shall be so glad if you go .
Doctors and dispensaries are no use to me .
And mind you shut the doors . &quot; The letter was from Oblonsky .
She knew that there was to be a consultation that day , and though she was only just up after her confinement ( she had another baby , a little girl , born at the end of the winter ) , though she had trouble and anxiety enough of her own , she had left her tiny baby and a sick child , to come and hear Kitty &apos;s fate , which was to be decided that day .
The conversation did not flag for an instant , so that the princess , who always kept in reserve , in case a subject should be lacking , two heavy guns - the relative advantages of classical and of modern education , and universal military service - had not to move out either of them , while Countess Nordston had not a chance of chaffing Levin .
I never hoped for it ; and yet in my heart I was always sure , &quot; he said .
They were firmly convinced that his real aim ( whatever he might say to them ) would always be in what he did not say to them .
I &apos;m not speaking of present company , for he &apos;s absent .
The prince rejoiced in health exceptional even among princes .
The silence lasted for two minutes : Dolly was thinking of herself .
Ah !
&quot; But as I told you then , and have written to you , &quot; he said in a thin , shrill voice , &quot; I repeat now , that I am not bound to know this .
All the same , she could not help saying to herself that she had charming children , all six of them in different ways , but a set of children such as is not often to be met with , and she was happy in them , and proud of them .
Seeing the husband , he was so overwhelmed that he sat down again , drawing his head down to his shoulders , as if he wanted to disappear ; but he made an effort over himself , got up and said : &quot; She is dying .
Have you read his article ? &quot; he asked Kritsky , sitting down again at the table , and moving back off half of it the scattered cigarettes , so as to clear a space .
&quot; All possible relations to the labor force have been defined and studied , &quot; he said .
&quot; If you want to be right , I can give you that satisfaction .
&quot; I hate him ; I can &apos;t forgive myself . &quot; &quot; Why , what for ? &quot; &quot; The shame , the humiliation ! &quot; &quot; Oh !
To leave him with his mother was out of the question .
He felt this at the mere sight of Ignat and the horses ; but when he had put on the sheepskin brought for him , had sat down wrapped up in the sledge , and had driven off pondering on the work that lay before him in the village , and staring at the side @-@ horse , that had been his saddle @-@ horse , past his prime now , but a spirited beast from the Don , he began to see what had happened to him in quite a different light .
His mother , who had her own separate property , had allowed Alexey every year twenty thousand in addition to the twenty @-@ five thousand he had reserved , and Alexey had spent it all .
Who is he ?
This dear good Sviazhsky , keeping a stock of ideas simply for social purposes , and obviously having some other principles hidden from Levin , while with the crowd , whose name is legion , he guided public opinion by ideas he did not share ; that irascible country gentleman , perfectly correct in the conclusions that he had been worried into by life , but wrong in his exasperation against a whole class , and that the best class in Russia ; his own dissatisfaction with the work he had been doing , and the vague hope of finding a remedy for all this - all was blended in a sense of inward turmoil , and anticipation of some solution near at hand .
The whole of that week he experienced a sensation such as a man might have set in charge of a dangerous madman , afraid of the madman , and at the same time , from being with him , fearing for his own reason .
Recognizing these persons as Russians , Kitty had already in her imagination begun constructing a delightful and touching romance about them .
&quot; Prince , let us have Konstantin Dmitrievitch , &quot; said Countess Nordston ; &quot; we want to try an experiment . &quot; &quot; What experiment ?
She looked round , and the same instant recognized Vronsky &apos;s face .
&quot; How could she fail to be ?
Though , instead of that , you &apos;d never believe it - the drunkenness , the immorality !
Her shining gray eyes , that looked dark from the thick lashes , rested with friendly attention on his face , as though she were recognizing him , and then promptly turned away to the passing crowd , as though seeking someone .
The glittering eyes looked sternly and reproachfully at his brother as he drew near .
After standing still a few seconds , she went into the carriage and sat down in her place .
When Vronsky saw her , coming across her in the mazurka , he did not at once recognize her , she was so changed .
It showed him the mistake men make in picturing to themselves happiness as the realization of their desires .
He opened the door , and Vronsky went into the horse @-@ box , dimly lighted by one little window .
Since then she had refused to see her husband .
If it &apos;s to be so , we &apos;d better go into the country . &quot; &quot; Well , and we had better . &quot; &quot; But do wait a minute .
That &apos;s very well . &quot; The princess went up to her husband , kissed him , and would have gone away , but he kept her , embraced her , and , tenderly as a young lover , kissed her several times , smiling .
I want a lawsuit , because I must have my property .
I have never spoken to anyone of this .
Her only motive is to avoid refusing and to please mamma .
&quot; Well , doctor ? &quot; &quot; Immediately , princess .
But what he liked particularly was the way in which at once , as though on purpose that there might be no misunderstanding with an outsider , she called Vronsky simply Alexey , and said they were moving into a house they had just taken , what was here called a palazzo .
Alexey Alexandrovitch stood so as to screen her , giving her time to recover herself .
In Varenka she realized that one has but to forget oneself and love others , and one will be calm , happy , and noble .
And how secretly , simply , and most of all , how trustfully !
When he had finished the leg he wanted to touch that figure , but he felt too much excited for it .
Christ would never have said those words if He had known how they would be abused .
Stepan Arkadyevitch moved quickly , as ever , to his place , shook hands with his colleagues , and sat down .
Yes , it is help I want now . &quot; When the deacon had finished the prayer for the Imperial family , the priest turned to the bridal pair with a book : &quot; Eternal God , that joinest together in love them that were separate , &quot; he read in a gentle , piping voice : &quot; who hast ordained the union of holy wedlock that cannot be set asunder , Thou who didst bless Isaac and Rebecca and their descendants , according to Thy Holy Covenant ; bless Thy servants , Konstantin and Ekaterina , leading them in the path of all good works .
Sometimes , too , he had experienced the opposite , expressing at last what he liked himself , which he was devising arguments to defend , and , chancing to express it well and genuinely , he had found his opponent at once agreeing and ceasing to dispute his position .
&quot; We expected you yesterday , princess , &quot; he said to Kitty .
But in her family she was strict in carrying out all that was required by the Church - and not merely in order to set an example , but with all her heart in it .
&quot; Don &apos;t you understand that from the day I loved you everything has changed for me ?
Only the corners remained to do , where the rows were short .
&quot; Yes , I am brought to the painful necessity of seeking a divorce , &quot; he said .
&quot; How queer you are today ! &quot; Dolly said to her .
He appreciated all kinds , and could have felt inspired by anyone of them ; but he had no conception of the possibility of knowing nothing at all of any school of painting , and of being inspired directly by what is within the soul , without caring whether what is painted will belong to any recognized school .
The same expression of delight replaced the look of uneasiness on Golenishtchev &apos;s face .
She tried to pull the portfolio away , but he pushed her back .
The silky grass with its ripe seeds came almost to his waist in the dampest spots .
&quot; No , I &apos;m first !
I &apos;m not afraid of anything .
The black velvet of her locket nestled with special softness round her neck .
&quot; A - a - a ! &quot; groaned Vronsky , clutching at his head .
They &apos;ve flung their caps over the windmills .
&quot; He is so happy , so absorbed in his races that he won &apos;t understand as he ought , he won &apos;t understand all the gravity of this fact to us . &quot; &quot; But you haven &apos;t told me what you were thinking of when I came in , &quot; he said , interrupting his narrative ; &quot; please tell me ! &quot; She did not answer , and , bending her head a little , she looked inquiringly at him from under her brows , her eyes shining under their long lashes .
I am so glad he can &apos;t bear me , &quot; she used to say of him .
It was just for this fineness of perception , for this delicacy , that Darya Alexandrovna liked Levin .
Forgive him . &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch gave him his hand , not attempting to restrain the tears that streamed from his eyes .
&quot; I did not tell you yesterday , &quot; she began , breathing quickly and painfully , &quot; that coming home with Alexey Alexandrovitch I told him everything ... told him I could not be his wife , that ... and told him everything . &quot; He heard her , unconsciously bending his whole figure down to her as though hoping in this way to soften the hardness of her position for her .
It seemed to her that such principles could only be a hindrance in farm management .
He did not succeed in adapting his face to the position in which he was placed towards his wife by the discovery of his fault .
He seems to know his work capitally , and to be very energetic . &quot; &quot; Yes , but what is his energy directed to ? &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch .
Alexey Alexandrovitch was the only person who did not once look in that direction , and was not diverted from the interesting discussion he had entered upon .
&quot; Still there is something terrible in it after all that has happened . &quot; &quot; It will all pass , it will all pass ; we shall be so happy .
In the drawing @-@ room there was no one ; at the sound of his steps there came out of her boudoir the midwife in a cap with lilac ribbons .
His present relation to Anna and to her husband was to his mind clear and simple .
&quot; To the stables , and I &apos;ve got to see Bryansky , too , about the horses , &quot; said Vronsky .
Please , do come .
&quot; It &apos;s too early for me to dine , but I must have a drink .
In his future married life there could be , he was convinced , nothing of that sort ; even the external forms , indeed , he fancied , must be utterly unlike the life of others in everything .
Have you counted the trees ? &quot; &quot; How count the trees ? &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , laughing , still trying to draw his friend out of his ill @-@ temper .
&quot; O my sweet ! &quot; he said inwardly to Frou @-@ Frou , as he listened for what was happening behind .
&quot; And I don &apos;t get on with other people .
&quot; Yes , _ might have been _ , &quot; he said mournfully .
I shall die easier with your forgiveness , &quot; he read .
Though it was said in a whisper , the sick man , whose hearing Levin had noticed was very keen , must have heard .
But Stepan Arkadyevitch apparently did not care to allow him the satisfaction of giving the French names of the dishes .
And this lack of candor in a matter of such gravity infuriated him .
&quot; It will come right somehow , &quot; he thought , and went towards the altar @-@ rails .
What has been wrong with you , and what did the doctor say ? &quot; She looked at him with mocking amusement .
&quot; Well , to put it shortly , I was convinced that nothing was really done by the district councils , or ever could be , &quot; he began , as though someone had just insulted him .
&quot; Oh , well , the window &apos;s open .
I know it &apos;s hard , but .... &quot; &quot; I have heard it said that women love men even for their vices , &quot; Anna began suddenly , &quot; but I hate him for his virtues .
A woman &apos;s step was heard mounting the stairs .
&quot; At the top , 12 and 13 , &quot; the porter answered Levin &apos;s inquiry .
This Russian girl was not , as Kitty gathered , related to Madame Stahl , nor was she a paid attendant .
A little old man in civilian dress , arranging his gray curls before another mirror , and diffusing an odor of scent , stumbled against them on the stairs , and stood aside , evidently admiring Kitty , whom he did not know .
&quot; No , truly ! &quot; And Levin went out of the room , only when he was in the doorway remembering that he had forgotten to take leave of Oblonsky &apos;s colleagues .
Again they were puzzled , and passed the rings from hand to hand , still without doing what was expected .
&quot; What ?
&quot; I don &apos;t understand it , I don &apos;t understand it , &quot; he said .
If England can point to the most brilliant feats of cavalry in military history , it is simply owing to the fact that she has historically developed this force both in beasts and in men .
&quot; I am fond of the country , &quot; said Vronsky , noticing , and affecting not to notice , Levin &apos;s tone .
And with his close assiduity , his conscientious devotion to his work , he &apos;s strained to the utmost ; and there &apos;s some outside burden weighing on him , and not a light one , &quot; concluded the doctor , raising his eyebrows significantly .
... &quot; dies without help ?
When Countess Nordston ventured to hint that she had hoped for something better , Kitty was so angry and proved so conclusively that nothing in the world could be better than Levin , that Countess Nordston had to admit it , and in Kitty &apos;s presence never met Levin without a smile of ecstatic admiration .
Baroness , some coffee for him out of the new coffee pot .
If not , it is very simple , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , feeling more and more free from constraint .
But he forgot many other essential matters , the want of which greatly distressed Darya Alexandrovna later on .
And there nothing took clear shape for him .
He did not like him , and regarded him now as his most formidable rival .
damn them all ! &quot; he thought as he went on working .
But you &apos;re not satisfied with that .
There came over him a dread and doubt - doubt of everything .
He was asking , too , the well @-@ known eccentric enthusiast , Pestsov , a liberal , a great talker , a musician , an historian , and the most delightfully youthful person of fifty , who would be a sauce or garnish for Koznishev and Karenin .
Kitty , hurriedly closing the door after Levin , was not looking that way ; but the sick man groaned , and she moved rapidly towards him .
Over his head Levin made out the stars of the Great Bear and lost them again .
But so soon as he recollected what he was doing , and began trying to do better , he was at once conscious of all the difficulty of his task , and the row was badly mown .
&quot; You can go .
He bent his head towards his shoulder and tried to look pitiful and humble , but for all that he was radiant with freshness and health .
He thought that the Russian people whose task it was to colonize and cultivate vast tracts of unoccupied land , consciously adhered , till all their land was occupied , to the methods suitable to their purpose , and that their methods were by no means so bad as was generally supposed .
I didn &apos;t even know you were in town .
&quot; Yes , &quot; she said , looking timidly towards the doorway , where Nikolay Levin had reappeared .
He remembered later the scandal over a boy , whom he had taken from the country to bring up , and , in a fit of rage , had so violently beaten that proceedings were brought against him for unlawfully wounding .
But their five years of official work together seemed to have put a barrier between them that cut off warmer relations .
&quot; It is awful !
You &apos;re wretched too , I know .
&quot; It &apos;s a disgraceful story , but killing .
He cannot believe it , he cannot comprehend now how he can have acted as he did . &quot; &quot; No ; he understands , he understood ! &quot; Dolly broke in .
&quot; Please don &apos;t talk to me about the opera ; you know nothing about music .
&quot; Ah , ah , ah !
&quot; Come along , I &apos;ve finished , &quot; said Vronsky , and getting up he went to the door .
He was saying you wouldn &apos;t know it from rye . &quot; &quot; Have you been sowing wheat long ? &quot; &quot; Why , sir , it was you taught us the year before last .
Yes - yes - yes ....
What a lovely thing !
She addressed the attaché , who was at a loss now what to begin upon .
And again he detected the expression of alarm in the eyes of Sviazhsky .
His brother was not to be seen .
Alexey Alexandrovitch was not long in hesitation .
&quot; How do you mean for nothing ? &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a good @-@ humored smile , knowing that nothing would be right in Levin &apos;s eyes now .
Tchirikov always gave a lively and good @-@ humored support to conversation of any sort .
As if you hadn &apos;t done enough for the peasants !
&quot; I have inevitably made that man wretched , &quot; she thought ; &quot; but I don &apos;t want to profit by his misery .
&quot; What ?
She suffered from headache and sickness , and she could not get up all the morning .
He &apos;s very nice .
The company got up at this moment to go into the garden .
&quot; Next week , and a splendid ball .
&quot; And so am I to be getting ready for a journey too ?
&quot; Ah !
And she had stood just as innocent in orange flowers and bridal veil .
There only , in the carriage that had crossed over to the other side of the road , and was rapidly disappearing , there only could he find the solution of the riddle of his life , which had weighed so agonizingly upon him of late .
They were loading a haycock onto the cart not far from him .
Eh ? &quot; queried Petritsky , blinking and rubbing his eyes .
As soon as the old prince turned away from him , Levin went out unnoticed , and the last impression he carried away with him of that evening was the smiling , happy face of Kitty answering Vronsky &apos;s inquiry about the ball .
The umpire who was starting them , Colonel Sestrin , was beginning to lose his temper , when at last for the fourth time he shouted &quot; Away ! &quot; and the racers started .
Possibly you are inclined to look at things too tragically . &quot; &quot; How I should like to know other people just as I know myself ! &quot; said Anna , seriously and dreamily .
Anna had been preparing herself for this meeting , had thought what she would say to him , but she did not succeed in saying anything of it ; his passion mastered her .
When Levin went into the kitchen to call his coachman he saw the whole family at dinner .
I &apos;m taking her her work . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s angel number one ? &quot; said the prince when Varenka had gone on .
These were a tall man with a stooping figure , and huge hands , in an old coat too short for him , with black , simple , and yet terrible eyes , and a pockmarked , kind @-@ looking woman , very badly and tastelessly dressed .
To the left , carts were rumbling over the meadow that had been already cleared , and one after another the haycocks vanished , flung up in huge forkfuls , and in their place there were rising heavy cartloads of fragrant hay hanging over the horses &quot; hind @-@ quarters .
&quot; Who can that be ? &quot; said Dolly .
Her face was still as beautiful , but it was only the more pitiful for that .
&quot; So it had to be , &quot; he said .
The bailiff listened attentively , and obviously made an effort to approve of his employer &apos;s projects .
He despises that feeling in me , but he knows that I won &apos;t abandon my child , that I can &apos;t abandon my child , that there could be no life for me without my child , even with him whom I love ; but that if I abandoned my child and ran away from him , I should be acting like the most infamous , basest of women .
And Levin himself in particular they were all extremely fond of that day .
She said : &quot; It &apos;s not a gentleman &apos;s work . &quot; Altogether , I fancy that in the people &apos;s ideas there are very clear and definite notions of certain , as they call it , &quot; gentlemanly &quot; lines of action .
Laska lay under the table ; Agafea Mihalovna settled herself in her place with her stocking .
&quot; Like a drink ? &quot; he turned to his brother , and at once became better humored .
The doctor .... Then .... &quot; Kitty hesitated ; she wanted to say further that ever since this change had taken place in her , Stepan Arkadyevitch had become insufferably repulsive to her , and that she could not see him without the grossest and most hideous conceptions rising before her imagination .
A Russian lady , I think she is , &quot; said the colonel .
He came into the dining hall , greeted everyone , and hurriedly sat down , smiling to his wife .
Venus , bright and silvery , shone with her soft light low down in the west behind the birch trees , and high up in the east twinkled the red lights of Arcturus .
He had often before had this sense of physical joy in his own body , but he had never felt so fond of himself , of his own body , as at that moment .
Moreover , it cannot be denied that the influence of the classical authors is in the highest degree moral , while , unfortunately , with the study of the natural sciences are associated the false and noxious doctrines which are the curse of our day . &quot; Sergey Ivanovitch would have said something , but Pestsov interrupted him in his rich bass .
We see this .... &quot; &quot; How about the proverb ? &quot; said the prince , who had a long while been intent on the conversation , his little comical eyes twinkling .
&quot; And can he ever join his father in punishing me ?
Chapter 28 When Alexey Alexandrovitch reached the race @-@ course , Anna was already sitting in the pavilion beside Betsy , in that pavilion where all the highest society had gathered .
Three days after his brother &apos;s departure , Levin too set off for his foreign tour .
And this is why .
Chapter 18 After the conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch , Vronsky went out onto the steps of the Karenins &quot; house and stood still , with difficulty remembering where he was , and where he ought to walk or drive .
Looking down at her he saw her face in profile , and from the scarcely perceptible quiver of her lips and eyelashes he knew she was aware of his eyes upon her .
It &apos;s very good for him and pleasant traveling about , and it &apos;s a settled arrangement for me to keep a carriage and coachman on the money . &quot; On his way to the remote provinces Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped for three days at Moscow .
With mingled feelings of annoyance at never being able to get away from acquaintances anywhere , and longing to find some sort of diversion from the monotony of his life , Vronsky looked once more at the gentleman , who had retreated and stood still again , and at the same moment a light came into the eyes of both .
Chapter 26 In the morning Konstantin Levin left Moscow , and towards evening he reached home .
I do love making a fool of him before Kitty , and I &apos;ll do it . &quot; &quot; Konstantin Dmitrievitch , &quot; she said to him , &quot; do explain to me , please , what &apos;s the meaning of it .
He knew what he wanted .
She skated a little uncertainly ; taking her hands out of the little muff that hung on a cord , she held them ready for emergency , and looking towards Levin , whom she had recognized , she smiled at him , and at her own fears .
Chapter 22 Alexey Alexandrovitch had forgotten the Countess Lidia Ivanovna , but she had not forgotten him .
After dinner I say things quite as good . &quot; &quot; After dinner there &apos;s no credit in them ?
And what was most important , the interests of the regiment were involved in it too .
He tried to say what he was not thinking , but he felt continually that it had a ring of falsehood , that his brother detected him in it , and was exasperated at it .
&quot; I have come up for a few days . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s something the matter with him , &quot; thought Countess Nordston , glancing at his stern , serious face .
Is it true ?
It happened of itself , &quot; she said irritably ; &quot; and see .... &quot; she pulled her husband &apos;s letter out of her glove .
Yes , I mustn &apos;t let it slip ; I must buy it , &quot; said Vronsky .
&quot; Friends we shall never be , you know that yourself .
And yet , now that years have passed , I recall it and wonder that it could distress me so much .
&quot; Oh , how can you steal upon anyone like that !
&quot; Don &apos;t break your neck !
&quot; I have long meant to tell you this , &quot; she went on , looking resolutely into his eyes , and hot all over from the burning flush on her cheeks .
Levin remembered that when Nikolay had been in the devout stage , the period of fasts and monks and church services , when he was seeking in religion a support and a curb for his passionate temperament , everyone , far from encouraging him , had jeered at him , and he , too , with the others .
I don &apos;t understand .
Who am I and what am I ?
And by no effort of the imagination could Kitty bring back the former Madame Stahl .
Vronsky , too , glanced out of the window and into Anna &apos;s eyes , and , turning at once to Golenishtchev , he said : &quot; Do you know this Mihailov ? &quot; &quot; I have met him .
How it would be proved he could not tell , but he knew that this would inevitably be logically proved to him , and he awaited the proofs .
Going a long way round by Gazetny Place and Kislovka , he went back again to the hotel , and putting his watch before him , he sat down to wait for twelve o &apos;clock .
But he could not say &quot; a fool , &quot; because Sviazhsky was unmistakably clever , and moreover , a highly cultivated man , who was exceptionally modest over his culture .
She had to let herself drop down to the reality to enjoy him as he really was .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry ; but what could I do ?
Alexey Alexandrovitch , to my thinking , is simply a fool .
In her presence he had no will of his own : without knowing the grounds of her distress , he already felt the same distress unconsciously passing over him .
It seemed to him that in a normal development of wealth in a state all these phenomena would arise only when a considerable amount of labor had been put into agriculture , when it had come under regular , or at least definite , conditions ; that the wealth of a country ought to increase proportionally , and especially in such a way that other sources of wealth should not outstrip agriculture ; that in harmony with a certain stage of agriculture there should be means of communication corresponding to it , and that in our unsettled condition of the land , railways , called into being by political and not by economic needs , were premature , and instead of promoting agriculture , as was expected of them , they were competing with agriculture and promoting the development of manufactures and credit , and so arresting its progress ; and that just as the one @-@ sided and premature development of one organ in an animal would hinder its general development , so in the general development of wealth in Russia , credit , facilities of communication , manufacturing activity , indubitably necessary in Europe , where they had arisen in their proper time , had with us only done harm , by throwing into the background the chief question calling for settlement - the question of the organization of agriculture .
In the next room they were talking about some sort of machines , and swindling , and coughing their morning coughs .
Levin spent that evening with his betrothed at Dolly &apos;s , and was in very high spirits .
She was generally a mistress of the art of dressing well without great expense , and before leaving Moscow she had given her dressmaker three dresses to transform .
Yes , and one hand , which will always be mine - the hand of my accomplice . &quot; She lifted up that hand and kissed it .
Anna said good @-@ bye to Vronsky , and drove home .
&quot; We have met , though we were not acquainted , at Soden , &quot; she said .
Will he come or not ?
But he was at home , and the walls of home are a support .
Vronsky respected and liked Yashvin particularly because he felt Yashvin liked him , not for his name and his money , but for himself .
&quot; Princess Elizaveta Federovna Tverskaya , &quot; the groom answered , and it seemed to Alexey Alexandrovitch that he grinned .
Kitty did in fact conceal her new views and feelings from her mother .
How &apos;s your farming getting on ? &quot; Levin knew that his elder brother took little interest in farming , and only put the question in deference to him , and so he only told him about the sale of his wheat and money matters .
Having once made up his mind that he was happy in his love , that he sacrificed his ambition to it - having anyway taken up this position , Vronsky was incapable of feeling either envious of Serpuhovskoy or hurt with him for not coming first to him when he came to the regiment .
In my opinion , influence over another people is only possible to the people which has the higher development , which .... &quot; &quot; But that &apos;s just the question , &quot; Pestsov broke in in his bass .
&quot; Eh ? &quot; responded Levin .
I always loved you alone , but I was carried away .
Should they have any milk ?
I .... &quot; &quot; I really didn &apos;t mean to hurt you , &quot; said Varenka , smiling .
So much the worse , since they won &apos;t be capable of satisfying them .
&quot; How do you feel ? &quot; Levin asked in a whisper , after a silence .
He was afraid of sullying what his soul was brimful of .
Ah !
The next two obstacles , the water course and the barrier , were easily crossed , but Vronsky began to hear the snorting and thud of Gladiator closer upon him .
&quot; That means that she &apos;s not slept again all night , &quot; he thought .
But what of that ?
that &apos;s the question . &quot; &quot; Yes , yes , unlighted . &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m very glad .
&quot; What , bored ! &quot; said Betsy .
He flushed slightly , and hurriedly asked her to waltz , but he had only just put his arm round her waist and taken the first step when the music suddenly stopped .
&quot; Don &apos;t put on your glove yet , princess ; let me kiss your hand .
Kitty began to entreat her mother still more urgently to let her make friends with Varenka .
&quot; You know I got rid of that woman . &quot; &quot; Marya Nikolaevna ?
Liza now is one of those naïve natures that , like children , don &apos;t know what &apos;s good and what &apos;s bad .
Often , just as he was beginning to understand the idea in the mind of anyone he was talking to , and was beginning to explain his own , he would suddenly be told : &quot; But Kauffmann , but Jones , but Dubois , but Michelli ?
She &apos;s a wonderful woman .
&quot; I can &apos;t understand how they can fall into such a gross mistake .
&quot; Oh , no ! &quot; said Levin with annoyance ; &quot; that method of doctoring I merely meant as a simile for doctoring the people with schools .
They , of course , follow her .
Levin knew too that Kitty had strengthened his hope by accounts of the marvelous recoveries she had heard of .
&quot; On Tuesday I shall be in Petersburg , and everything can be settled . &quot; &quot; Yes , &quot; she said .
On the other table by the patient &apos;s bed there were candles and drink and powders .
He talked of this , and passionately longed to hear more of Kitty , and , at the same time , was afraid of hearing it .
But he heard it indistinctly through the sound of his own footsteps , and hoped he was mistaken .
&quot; Now turn me over on the left side and go to bed , &quot; he said .
They &apos;re positively afraid she may not live . &quot; &quot; What ! &quot; cried Levin .
Levin and he were very friendly , and so Levin used to venture to sound Sviazhsky , to try to get at the very foundation of his view of life ; but it was always in vain .
&quot; I don &apos;t remember what I said .
&quot; Now I want to begin a suit against him .
He &apos;s living now not far from us , and I see him sometimes .
Kitty was no longer struck by this contrast .
I experienced a queer feeling once , &quot; he went on .
The conversation fell on the village commune , in which Pestsov saw a sort of special principle , called by him the &quot; choral &quot; principle .
He was looking towards the door , and his face wore a strange new expression .
&quot; I &apos;m awfully sorry for you !
&quot; No , I must sleep ! &quot; He moved the cushion up , and pressed his head into it , but he had to make an effort to keep his eyes shut .
Three years ago he was in just the same position as I am .
it &apos;s a torture to me to see him . &quot; &quot; Dolly , darling , he has spoken to me , but I want to hear it from you : tell me about it . &quot; Dolly looked at her inquiringly .
&quot; You are scarcely changed at all , &quot; the prince said to her .
There is some misunderstanding , &quot; said he .
He felt disgraced , humiliated , guilty , and deprived of all possibility of washing away his humiliation .
&quot; But I know everything that &apos;s interesting : the plum soup I know , and the pea sausages I know .
How exquisite ! &quot; they cried with one voice .
For me to live with him now would be torture , just because I love my past love for him .... &quot; And sobs cut short her words .
The muscles of both hind- and fore @-@ legs were not very thick ; but across her shoulders the mare was exceptionally broad , a peculiarity specially striking now that she was lean from training .
Chapter 6 Mashkin Upland was mown , the last row finished , the peasants had put on their coats and were gaily trudging home .
The mare glanced aslant at him , drew up her lip , and twitched her ear .
&quot; She is to be here from Petersburg today . &quot; &quot; I was looking out for you till two o &apos;clock last night .
Alexey Alexandrovitch hoped that this passion would pass , as everything does pass , that everyone would forget about it , and his name would remain unsullied .
I am your husband , and I love you . &quot; For an instant her face fell , and the mocking gleam in her eyes died away ; but the word _ love _ threw her into revolt again .
&quot; Yes .
&quot; But Alexey Alexandrovitch , my celebrated brother @-@ in @-@ law , you surely must know .
Stop a minute , stoop down , &quot; said Kitty &apos;s sister , Madame Lvova , and with her plump , handsome arms she smilingly set straight the flowers on her head .
The deputation , though it had been summoned at Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s instigation , was not without its discomforting and even dangerous aspect , and he was glad he had found it in Moscow .
I have come to look very differently and more charitably on what is called infamous since brother Nikolay has become what he is ... you know what he did .... &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s awful , awful ! &quot; repeated Levin .
He sat down with a smile , facing her , felt her pulse , and again began asking her tiresome questions .
No , I don &apos;t see why there should not be a new force , if it .... &quot; &quot; Why , because with electricity , &quot; Levin interrupted again , &quot; every time you rub tar against wool , a recognized phenomenon is manifested , but in this case it does not happen every time , and so it follows it is not a natural phenomenon . &quot; Feeling probably that the conversation was taking a tone too serious for a drawing @-@ room , Vronsky made no rejoinder , but by way of trying to change the conversation , he smiled brightly , and turned to the ladies .
Divide it in halves , give half as the share of labor , the surplus left you will be greater , and the share of labor will be greater too .
You &apos;re in a new phase again , I see - a conservative , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch .
He glanced at her ; she blushed , and ceased speaking .
&quot; No , I haven &apos;t time ; I &apos;ve only looked in for a tiny second , &quot; answered Stepan Arkadyevitch .
Seryozha must be moved into the corner room , and Mariette must be asked to sleep with him . &quot; All of a sudden she shrank back , was silent ; and in terror , as though expecting a blow , as though to defend herself , she raised her hands to her face .
&quot; Very well , the next one , &quot; she said hurriedly , turning over the pages , and at once feeling that there was something connected with the song .
Chapter 31 Running halfway down the staircase , Levin caught a sound he knew , a familiar cough in the hall .
&quot; Can I help loving him ? &quot; she said to herself , looking deeply into his scared and at the same time delighted eyes .
She shut the bureau with a slam , and glanced at him .
Has Seryozha had his dinner ?
But the picture of the boys had imprinted itself on their memories , and they were continually coming back to it .
Separation from the son she loved - even that did not cause her anguish in these early days .
He jumped up and sat down .
All this and much more flashed into Mihailov &apos;s thoughts .
She felt that there was something that had to do with her in it , and something that ought not to have been .
&quot; How are you ? &quot; &quot; Tell me , how is my darling Anna ? &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch mumbled something and would have gone on .
The sick man alone did not express this feeling , but on the contrary was furious at their not getting him doctors , and went on taking medicine and talking of life .
He left soon after you did , and he &apos;s not once been in Moscow since .
The telegram was from his wife .
&quot; The manner of life you have chosen is reflected , I suppose , in your ideas .
At the very instant when this apparition was vanishing , the truthful eyes glanced at him .
They &apos;re all as pleased as brass halfpence .
Vronsky &apos;s interest in painting and the Middle Ages did not last long .
But he had religious scruples , which hindered the execution of such a plan .
The word _ talent _ , by which they meant an inborn , almost physical , aptitude apart from brain and heart , and in which they tried to find an expression for all the artist had gained from life , recurred particularly often in their talk , as though it were necessary for them to sum up what they had no conception of , though they wanted to talk of it .
Whether it was that the children were fickle , or that they had acute senses , and felt that Anna was quite different that day from what she had been when they had taken such a fancy to her , that she was not now interested in them , - but they had abruptly dropped their play with their aunt , and their love for her , and were quite indifferent that she was going away .
Would you believe it , that knowing he &apos;s a good man , a splendid man , that I &apos;m not worth his little finger , still I hate him .
And of all men he was the only one with whom Vronsky would have liked to speak of his love .
Levin gave him the bottle , and the same look of passionate hope with which he had taken the sacrament was now fastened on his brother , demanding from him the confirmation of the doctor &apos;s words that inhaling iodine worked wonders .
Chapter 24 The night spent by Levin on the haycock did not pass without result for him .
You &apos;re afraid of spiders , and I of these vermin .
An unpleasant sensation gripped at her heart when she met his obstinate and weary glance , as though she had expected to see him different .
Here ! &quot; Madame Karenina , however , did not wait for her brother , but catching sight of him she stepped out with her light , resolute step .
Alexey Alexandrovitch did not know that his friend Lidia Ivanovna , noticing that he was not as well as usual that year , had begged the doctor to go and examine him .
And he &apos;s an awfully nice clever old fellow .
There &apos;s a fearful tragedy in it . &quot; &quot; If you care for my profession of faith as regards that , I &apos;ll tell you that I don &apos;t believe there was any tragedy about it .
Ring the bell , I &apos;ll have tea .
People who can do nothing else ought to rear people while the rest work for their happiness and enlightenment .
But all this Levin did not think out .
The colonel of the regiment was waited upon by the government clerk , Venden , with a complaint against his officers , who had insulted his wife .
But however are you going to race in this mud ? &quot; said the other .
&quot; Who has decked the heavenly firmament with its lights ?
&quot; I saw Vronsky and did not tell him .
You drag a ton of earth on your shoes . &quot; &quot; Why is it you have earth that &apos;s not sifted ? &quot; said Levin .
Yes , it was the same thing over and over again .
Konstantin Levin , whose presence was needed in the plough land and meadows , had come to take his brother in the trap .
&quot; None whatever , &quot; said Vronsky , laughing and showing his even rows of teeth .
Why , if I were a man , I could never care for anyone else after knowing you .
Anna experienced almost physical pleasure in the sensation of his nearness , and his caresses , and moral soothing , when she met his simple , confiding , and loving glance , and heard his naïve questions .
&quot; And I tell you what , Katia , &quot; he went on to his younger daughter , &quot; you must wake up one fine day and say to yourself : Why , I &apos;m quite well , and merry , and going out again with father for an early morning walk in the frost .
Could a man of any feeling live in the same house with his unfaithful wife ?
A setter bitch , Laska , ran out too , almost upsetting Kouzma , and whining , turned round about Levin &apos;s knees , jumping up and longing , but not daring , to put her forepaws on his chest .
He felt that the mare was at her very last reserve of strength ; not her neck and shoulders merely were wet , but the sweat was standing in drops on her mane , her head , her sharp ears , and her breath came in short , sharp gasps .
&quot; I think it &apos;s the wet @-@ nurse , sir , &quot; the Englishwoman said firmly .
She lay back submissively , and looked before her with beaming eyes .
&quot; Yes , she was unhappy before , but proud and at peace ; and now she cannot be at peace and feel secure in her dignity , though she does not show it .
Your answer as to whether you will undertake to conduct the case , and on what terms , you will be so good as to communicate to me . &quot; &quot; Very good . &quot; The lawyer bowed respectfully , let his client out of the door , and , left alone , gave himself up to his sense of amusement .
There &apos;s only one way of having love conveniently without its being a hindrance - that &apos;s marriage .
These were the most blissful moments .
Sappho Shtoltz was a blonde beauty with black eyes .
&quot; She took my hand then and examined the lines &quot; You &apos;ve got a splendid hand , &quot; she said . &quot; And he looked at his own hand and the short hand of the deacon .
That &apos;s her manner - _ grande dame , _ &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch .
It is true that her tone was the same as Sappho &apos;s ; that like Sappho , she had two men , one young and one old , tacked onto her , and devouring her with their eyes .
You suffer only from pride .... &quot; &quot; Perhaps so , &quot; said Levin , &quot; but .... &quot; She interrupted him .
&quot; And that &apos;s his wife , &quot; she added , indicating Anna Pavlovna , who , as though on purpose , at the very instant they approached walked away after a child that had run off along a path .
Vronsky felt his elevation and his own abasement , his truth and his own falsehood .
&quot; But something was said in it : I am dying .... &quot; He read the telegram again , and suddenly the plain meaning of what was said in it struck him .
What was the matter with the boy ?
As everyone had been listening while Princess Myakaya spoke , and so the conversation around the ambassador &apos;s wife had dropped , Princess Betsy tried to bring the whole party together , and turned to the ambassador &apos;s wife .
When she thought of Vronsky , it seemed to her that he did not love her , that he was already beginning to be tired of her , that she could not offer herself to him , and she felt bitter against him for it .
She was not simply miserable , she began to feel alarm at the new spiritual condition , never experienced before , in which she found herself .
your excellency ! &quot; cried Oblonsky , &quot; whom are you meeting ? &quot; &quot; My mother , &quot; Vronsky responded , smiling , as everyone did who met Oblonsky .
&quot; But I can congratulate you on the purchase , Mihail Ignatitch ? &quot; &quot; Well , well .... &quot; Chapter 17 Stepan Arkadyevitch went upstairs with his pocket bulging with notes , which the merchant had paid him for three months in advance .
All the traits of his character , which she learned to know better and better , were unutterably dear to her .
How , how am I to tell you what I mean ? &quot; said Serpuhovskoy , who liked similes .
&quot; I admit that manly sports do not .... &quot; he was continuing .
He jumped up at the doctor &apos;s voice , took his hands from his face , and saw Alexey Alexandrovitch .
&quot; To sleep !
And remember that I love you , and shall always love you as my dearest friend ! &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know why , &quot; said Anna , kissing her and hiding her tears .
&quot; Or we &apos;ll go together .
&quot; Make haste with the ice ! &quot; the doctor &apos;s peremptory voice said from the bedroom .
He was so completely absorbed in his feeling for Anna , that he did not even think what o &apos;clock it was , and whether he had time to go to Bryansky &apos;s .
&quot; What &apos;s to be done ?
She was in doubt .
He felt that he could not turn aside from himself the hatred of men , because that hatred did not come from his being bad ( in that case he could have tried to be better ) , but from his being shamefully and repulsively unhappy .
Conscious of it , and conscious that any expression of his feelings at that minute would be out of keeping with the position , he tried to suppress every manifestation of life in himself , and so neither stirred nor looked at her .
&quot; No , joking apart , whatever you choose is sure to be good .
All that was drowned in a sea of merry common labor .
I love him , I am his mistress ; I can &apos;t bear you ; I &apos;m afraid of you , and I hate you .... You can do what you like to me . &quot; And dropping back into the corner of the carriage , she broke into sobs , hiding her face in her hands .
&quot; Yes , yes , I understand you , &quot; he brought out at last .
She rose quickly , and laid her hand on Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s sleeve .
&quot; Yes , a dream , &quot; she said .
&quot; Preparations shall be made for your arrival here ...
&quot; Well , what of it ?
I &apos;m so happy that I &apos;ve become positively hateful ; I &apos;ve forgotten everything .
Levin saw proofs of this in his dress , in the old @-@ fashioned threadbare coat , obviously not his everyday attire , in his shrewd , deep @-@ set eyes , in his idiomatic , fluent Russian , in the imperious tone that had become habitual from long use , and in the resolute gestures of his large , red , sunburnt hands , with an old betrothal ring on the little finger .
And consequently , not being able to believe in the significance of what he was doing nor to regard it with indifference as an empty formality , during the whole period of preparing for the sacrament he was conscious of a feeling of discomfort and shame at doing what he did not himself understand , and what , as an inner voice told him , was therefore false and wrong .
&quot; I did not read it through .
Perhaps it is the confinement .
But he would not see anything , and he did not see it .
He thought and wrote , never losing the happy consciousness of her presence .
He was the familiar friend of everyone with whom he took a glass of champagne , and he took a glass of champagne with everyone , and when in consequence he met any of his disreputable chums , as he used in joke to call many of his friends , in the presence of his subordinates , he well knew how , with his characteristic tact , to diminish the disagreeable impression made on them .
&quot; He &apos;s right ! &quot; she said ; &quot; of course , he &apos;s always right ; he &apos;s a Christian , he &apos;s generous !
&quot; Not one word , not one gesture of yours shall I , could I , ever forget .... &quot; &quot; Enough , enough ! &quot; she cried trying assiduously to give a stern expression to her face , into which he was gazing greedily .
I &apos;ll walk , and fancy myself at the springs again . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no hurry , &quot; said Anna .
If I retire , I burn my ships .
Vronsky knew that it was all about the same thing .
This confirmed Levin still more in his suspicions .
They don &apos;t know how he has crushed my life for eight years , crushed everything that was living in me - he has not once even thought that I &apos;m a live woman who must have love .
It seemed to her that his big , terrible eyes , which persistently pursued her , expressed a feeling of hatred and contempt , and she tried to avoid meeting him .
When Stepan Arkadyevitch had disappeared , she went back to the sofa where she had been sitting , surrounded by the children .
It &apos;s so cooling .
She knows where her master &apos;s going ! &quot; he added , patting Laska , who hung about Levin , whining and licking his hands , his boots , and his gun .
&quot; And the door , do shut the door ! &quot; he cried .
Either get a shawl , or come indoors . &quot; &quot; It really is time to go in ! &quot; said Varenka , getting up .
Yes , and now you physic her and call in these quacks . &quot; The prince apparently had plenty more to say , but as soon as the princess heard his tone she subsided at once , and became penitent , as she always did on serious occasions .
What for ? &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a smile .
&quot; Where are you off to in such haste ? &quot; &quot; Maman &apos;s here , &quot; she said , turning to Kitty .
&quot; Well , I &apos;m glad you were successful , &quot; said Levin , who , at the same time , had a sense of envy that he had not succeeded in shooting the snipe .
&quot; Forgive me , I &apos;m nervous , I &apos;m unjust , &quot; she said , controlling herself , &quot; but do go away .... &quot; &quot; No , it can &apos;t go on like this , &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself decidedly as he left his wife &apos;s room .
&quot; Yes , yes , how was it now ? &quot; he thought , going over his dream .
It is proved .... &quot; And with his characteristic clearness , he summed up those new , very important , and interesting revelations .
And owing to the bent of his character , and because he loved the dying man more than anyone else did , Levin was most painfully conscious of this deceit .
&quot; It &apos;s fortunate , &quot; said he , &quot; especially as I was meaning to ask you to excuse me , and to be taking leave .
Ryabinin looked towards the door and shook his head with a smile .
She knew , too , that he was really interested in books dealing with politics , philosophy , and theology , that art was utterly foreign to his nature ; but , in spite of this , or rather , in consequence of it , Alexey Alexandrovitch never passed over anything in the world of art , but made it his duty to read everything .
can I be like that ? &quot; he thought .
But see the grass missed out !
Behind him he heard voices : &quot; It &apos;s not set right ; handle &apos;s too high ; see how he has to stoop to it , &quot; said one .
I cannot come out , but I cannot go on longer without seeing you .
He sank on his knees and tried to see her face ; but she hid it , and said nothing .
It seemed to Levin that he had deceived someone , that he ought to explain something , but that to explain it was impossible , and for that reason he was continually blushing , was ill at ease and awkward .
&quot; I am obliged to tell you that your behavior has been unbecoming today , &quot; he said to her in French .
I &apos;m going to him . &quot; Anna looked at him with dreamy , shining eyes , and said nothing .
And therefore it would be correct to say that women are seeking duties , and quite legitimately .
&quot; He is dying ! &quot; she whispered .
She knew that feeling and knew its signs , and saw them in Anna ; saw the quivering , flashing light in her eyes , and the smile of happiness and excitement unconsciously playing on her lips , and the deliberate grace , precision , and lightness of her movements .
I can &apos;t make both ends meet over it .
&quot; That &apos;s what I &apos;ve come for .
But , directly he would have made a step to come nearer to her , she was aware of his presence , pushed away the watering pot , and turned her flushed face towards him .
Mihailov did not remember his surname nor where he had met him , nor what he had said to him .
Her first impulse was to jerk back her hand from the damp hand with big swollen veins that sought hers , but with an obvious effort to control herself she pressed his hand .
My brother and I are terribly in fault , I see .
On the woman question he was on the side of the extreme advocates of complete liberty for women , and especially their right to labor .
&quot; This way !
When you talk about it - it &apos;s only then it worries me . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand , &quot; he said .
And besides , I &apos;m very well off . &quot; &quot; Very well off - for the time .
She , recognizing that she was wrong , though she did not say so , became tenderer to him , and they experienced new , redoubled happiness in their love .
Ah , here it is : have a glass ! &quot; The fête at the colonel &apos;s lasted a long while .
&quot; I could go all around the world with you and never be dull .
Madame Stahl learned later on that Varenka was not her own child , but she went on bringing her up , especially as very soon afterwards Varenka had not a relation of her own living .
&quot; Stay , stay , &quot; he began , interrupting Oblonsky .
They are all on the defensive , lose their tempers , as though they all want to make one feel something .... &quot; &quot; Yes , that &apos;s true , it is so , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , laughing good @-@ humoredly .
This interference aroused in him a feeling of angry hatred - a feeling he had rarely known before .
She gave him no encouragement , but every time she met him there surged up in her heart that same feeling of quickened life that had come upon her that day in the railway carriage when she saw him for the first time .
When he had drunk his coffee , Levin rode back again to the mowing before Sergey Ivanovitch had had time to dress and come down to the dining @-@ room .
No , this is my unhappiness .... &quot; She could hear the sound of her son &apos;s voice coming towards them , and glancing swiftly round the terrace , she got up impulsively .
Seeing her , he found himself face to face with one of the pictures of his daydream of family life .
A. Karenin &quot; _ P.S. _ - I enclose the money which may be needed for your expenses . &quot; He read the letter through and felt pleased with it , and especially that he had remembered to enclose money : there was not a harsh word , not a reproach in it , nor was there undue indulgence .
I ... didn &apos;t .... &quot; he said , trying to make out from her expression what was in store for him in regard to the peaches .
As the first quadrille had already been given to Vronsky , she had to promise this youth the second .
Her guests stepped out at the wide entrance , and the stout porter , who used to read the newspapers in the mornings behind the glass door , to the edification of the passers @-@ by , noiselessly opened the immense door , letting the visitors pass by him into the house .
&quot; What !
I have done nothing wrong .
He stood , listened , and gazed sometimes down at the wet mossy ground , sometimes at Laska listening all alert , sometimes at the sea of bare tree tops that stretched on the slope below him , sometimes at the darkening sky , covered with white streaks of cloud .
Serpuhovskoy was a good friend , and he was delighted he had come .
You speak of his talking of you with her .
She thought that she was the only person who knew why he had come , and why he would not come up .
&quot; Hi , something for the count to eat !
The liberal party said , or rather allowed it to be understood , that religion is only a curb to keep in check the barbarous classes of the people ; and Stepan Arkadyevitch could not get through even a short service without his legs aching from standing up , and could never make out what was the object of all the terrible and high @-@ flown language about another world when life might be so very amusing in this world .
&quot; What is the matter with him today ?
Levin was in a continual state of awkwardness and discomfort , but the intensity of his happiness went on all the while increasing .
Anna read the note and heaved a deep sigh .
&quot; I will do it for the sake of Russia , countess , &quot; replied the doctor .
The second class - eight thousand roubles - consisted of less important debts .
And now behold - anticipation and uncertainty and remorse at the abandonment of the old life - all was ending , and the new was beginning .
You are a Christian .
She pines and pines away .
Every face that , with such agony , such blunders and corrections had grown up within him with its special character , every face that had given him such torments and such raptures , and all these faces so many times transposed for the sake of the harmony of the whole , all the shades of color and tones that he had attained with such labor - all of this together seemed to him now , looking at it with their eyes , the merest vulgarity , something that had been done a thousand times over .
&quot; One thing I would say , &quot; began Anna .
There was entreaty for forgiveness , and trust in him , and tenderness - soft , timid tenderness - and promise and hope and love for him , which he could not but believe in and which choked him with happiness .
And suddenly he was met by a lowering expression he had never seen in her .
Walking across the yard , passing a snowdrift by the lilac tree , he went into the cowhouse .
With a child &apos;s keen instinct for every manifestation of feeling , he saw distinctly that his father , his governess , his nurse , - all did not merely dislike Vronsky , but looked on him with horror and aversion , though they never said anything about him , while his mother looked on him as her greatest friend .
Just listen how the deacon booms out , &quot; And fearing her husband . &quot; &quot; &quot; Are the choristers from Tchudovo ? &quot; &quot; No , from the Synod . &quot; &quot; I asked the footman .
She herself went several times to her room , regardless of the men she met in the corridor , got out and brought in sheets , pillow cases , towels , and shirts .
( Nothing would be left him if he lost faith in it . )
Would you seal it up , please , and send it off ? &quot; she said from the door ; &quot; I have to give some directions . &quot; Without a moment &apos;s thought , Anna sat down to the table with Betsy &apos;s letter , and , without reading it , wrote below : &quot; It &apos;s essential for me to see you .
&quot; This is a pretty story of yours about the shirt ! &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch , shaking his head and smiling .
Alexey Alexandrovitch had been maintaining that the Russification of Poland could only be accomplished as a result of larger measures which ought to be introduced by the Russian government .
Now , by the abolition of serfdom we have been deprived of our authority ; and so our husbandry , where it had been raised to a high level , is bound to sink to the most savage primitive condition .
The place where she stood seemed to him a holy shrine , unapproachable , and there was one moment when he was almost retreating , so overwhelmed was he with terror .
But Sviazhsky did not explain , and saw no need to explain why it was interesting to him .
At half @-@ past seven she had only just gone down into the drawing @-@ room , when the footman announced , &quot; Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin . &quot; The princess was still in her room , and the prince had not come in .
Chapter 2 Stepan Arkadyevitch was a truthful man in his relations with himself .
&quot; The courier asks if there &apos;s an answer , &quot; the footman announced .
It was as though her nature were so brimming over with something that against her will it showed itself now in the flash of her eyes , and now in her smile .
On the previous day Stepan Arkadyevitch had appeared at the office in a uniform , and the new chief had been very affable and had talked to him as to an acquaintance .
He could not fail to recognize Yashvin &apos;s voice though he did not see him .
&quot; My sympathies are classical from education , but in this discussion I am personally unable to arrive at a conclusion .
His brother got into bed , and whether he slept or did not sleep , tossed about like a sick man , coughed , and when he could not get his throat clear , mumbled something .
In the horse @-@ box stood a dark bay mare , with a muzzle on , picking at the fresh straw with her hoofs .
Oh , you &apos;ve not been to see our school , have you ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen it ....
Levin glanced once more at Turovtsin , and wondered how it was he had not realized all this man &apos;s goodness before .
&quot; You wait a bit , wait a bit , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , smiling and touching his hand .
If there was a reason for his preferring liberal to conservative views , which were held also by many of his circle , it arose not from his considering liberalism more rational , but from its being in closer accordance with his manner of life .
No , I won &apos;t . &quot; She laid her two hands on his shoulders , and looked a long while at him with a profound , passionate , and at the same time searching look .
So you &apos;ve come back to our corrupt Babylon , &quot; she said , giving him her tiny , yellow hand , and recalling what he had chanced to say early in the winter , that Moscow was a Babylon .
But , as I told you at the time , I couldn &apos;t say which had the better chance .
The fiend was the name they had given her jealousy .
The leaf in her hand shook more violently , but she did not take her eyes off him , watching how he would take it .
That this was a trick and a fraud , of that , he thought for the first minute , there could be no doubt .
But suppose that I agree to everything , that I want nothing : what way is there of getting out of our position ? &quot; &quot; If you care to know my opinion , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch with the same smile of softening , almond @-@ oil tenderness with which he had been talking to Anna .
Are your things sent off ? &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch .
Petritsky , who knew he was ill @-@ tempered on such occasions , on waking up and seeing his comrade at the writing @-@ table , quietly dressed and went out without getting in his way .
You couldn &apos;t consent to marry me .
On her head , among her black hair - her own , with no false additions - was a little wreath of pansies , and a bouquet of the same in the black ribbon of her sash among white lace .
&quot; Why should you .... &quot; &quot; Why ?
I &apos;m used to looking after such invalids . &quot; &quot; Yes , I &apos;ve heard you live at Mentone with your aunt - I think - Madame Stahl : I used to know her _ belle @-@ sœur _ . &quot; &quot; No , she &apos;s not my aunt .
&quot; In what way has my behavior been unbecoming ? &quot; she said aloud , turning her head swiftly and looking him straight in the face , not with the bright expression that seemed covering something , but with a look of determination , under which she concealed with difficulty the dismay she was feeling .
Chapter 19 When Anna went into the room , Dolly was sitting in the little drawing @-@ room with a white @-@ headed fat little boy , already like his father , giving him a lesson in French reading .
&quot; No , please tell me ! &quot; &quot; Tell you everything ? &quot; asked Varenka .
His heart warmed to Golenishtchev for this remark , and from a state of depression he suddenly passed to ecstasy .
The prince &apos;s manner of treating the very people who , to Vronsky &apos;s surprise , were ready to descend to any depths to provide him with Russian amusements , was contemptuous .
She saw him before he saw her , and she saw that he was thinking of her .
I am free till three . &quot; &quot; No , &quot; answered Levin , after an instant &apos;s thought , &quot; I have got to go on somewhere else . &quot; &quot; All right , then , let &apos;s dine together . &quot; &quot; Dine together ?
I &apos;ve one lady extra to dinner with me , and no man to take her in .
&quot; You were to blame .
You think it mean of me to count the trees in my forest , while you make Ryabinin a present of thirty thousand ; but you get rents from your lands and I don &apos;t know what , while I don &apos;t and so I prize what &apos;s come to me from my ancestors or been won by hard work .... We are aristocrats , and not those who can only exist by favor of the powerful of this world , and who can be bought for twopence halfpenny . &quot; &quot; Well , but whom are you attacking ?
You &apos;re right though , I dare say .
The presence of Princess Tverskaya was unpleasant to Alexey Alexandrovitch from the memories associated with her , and also because he disliked her , and he went straight to the nursery .
Her connection with this circle was kept up through Princess Betsy Tverskaya , her cousin &apos;s wife , who had an income of a hundred and twenty thousand roubles , and who had taken a great fancy to Anna ever since she first came out , showed her much attention , and drew her into her set , making fun of Countess Lidia Ivanovna &apos;s coterie .
And this solution was in favor of Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s contention .
A little light hussar in tight riding breeches rode off at a gallop , crouched up like a cat on the saddle , in imitation of English jockeys .
When the Tatar appeared with a bill for twenty @-@ six roubles and odd kopecks , besides a tip for himself , Levin , who would another time have been horrified , like anyone from the country , at his share of fourteen roubles , did not notice it , paid , and set off homewards to dress and go to the Shtcherbatskys &quot; there to decide his fate .
&quot; Everything that interests him , interests me . &quot; But who will she be ? &quot; And he remembered what had happened at Moscow .... &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing to be done .... It &apos;s not my fault .
From the center and outside of the ring all were crowding to the winning post , and a group of soldiers and officers of the horse @-@ guards were shouting loudly their delight at the expected triumph of their officer and comrade .
I told you long ago , &quot; he said , turning to Liza Merkalova , &quot; that if you don &apos;t want to be bored , you mustn &apos;t think you &apos;re going to be bored .
What have I ever known ? &quot; she said , &quot; what you tell me .
She saw that Kitty did not merely imitate Varenka in her conduct , but unconsciously imitated her in her manner of walking , of talking , of blinking her eyes .
&quot; Pierre , give me the coffee , &quot; she said , addressing Petritsky , whom she called Pierre as a contraction of his surname , making no secret of her relations with him .
Kamerovsky got up too , and Vronsky , not waiting for him to go , shook hands and went off to his dressing @-@ room .
He got up from the sofa , took off his coat , undid his belt , and uncovering his hairy chest to breathe more freely , walked up and down the room .
Chapter 10 The artist Mihailov was , as always , at work when the cards of Count Vronsky and Golenishtchev were brought to him .
He remembered how he had kissed it and then had examined the lines on the pink palm .
&quot; Oh , everyone knows him ! &quot; &quot; And I see you think he &apos;s a horrid man ? &quot; &quot; Not horrid , but nothing in him . &quot; &quot; Oh , you &apos;re wrong !
&quot; If I &apos;d been a Roman woman I should never have missed a single circus . &quot; Anna said nothing , and keeping her opera @-@ glass up , gazed always at the same spot .
Give her to the nurse . &quot; &quot; Anna Arkadyevna , he has come .
Vronsky bowed low and pushed a chair up for her .
But as the artist lived in a remote suburb , it was decided to take the carriage .
And going once again over the conditions inseparable from a duel , a divorce , a separation , and once again rejecting them , Alexey Alexandrovitch felt convinced that there was only one solution , - to keep her with him , concealing what had happened from the world , and using every measure in his power to break off the intrigue , and still more - though this he did not admit to himself - to punish her .
&quot; There &apos;s never any finding you . &quot; Alexander Vronsky , in spite of the dissolute life , and in especial the drunken habits , for which he was notorious , was quite one of the court circle .
Her face was white and set .
But the princess , having ascertained from the visitors &quot; list that this was Nikolay Levin and Marya Nikolaevna , explained to Kitty what a bad man this Levin was , and all her fancies about these two people vanished .
&quot; Why did you give them me ?
She felt so light @-@ hearted and serene , she saw so clearly that all that had seemed to her so important on her railway journey was only one of the common trivial incidents of fashionable life , and that she had no reason to feel ashamed before anyone else or before herself .
The silence ( though it lasted no more than a minute ) became too intolerable to him .
He went up to her , took her by the hand , and asked her to sit down .
He counted forty @-@ two of them .
Anna glancing down at once recognized Vronsky , and a strange feeling of pleasure and at the same time of dread of something stirred in her heart .
If on hearing this news he were to say to her resolutely , passionately , without an instant &apos;s wavering : &quot; Throw up everything and come with me ! &quot; she would give up her son and go away with him .
These two ladies were the chief representatives of a select new Petersburg circle , nicknamed , in imitation of some imitation , _ les sept merveilles du monde _ .
&quot; Let me introduce myself . &quot; The painter bowed and smiled , showing his strangely dazzling white teeth .
Then he remembered how he had spent a night in the lockup for disorderly conduct in the street .
&quot; What is it ?
Although Stepan Arkadyevitch was completely in the wrong as regards his wife , and was conscious of this himself , almost everyone in the house ( even the nurse , Darya Alexandrovna &apos;s chief ally ) was on his side .
I sometimes even have doubts of the existence of God , &quot; Levin could not help saying , and he was horrified at the impropriety of what he was saying .
&quot; Are there any papers from the office ? &quot; asked Stepan Arkadyevitch , taking the telegram and seating himself at the looking @-@ glass .
&quot; I should so like to see how you skate .
You &apos;re more wrong externally , and he inwardly . &quot; &quot; Ah , ah !
&quot; What seems strange to me is that women should seek fresh duties , &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch , &quot; while we see , unhappily , that men usually try to avoid them . &quot; &quot; Duties are bound up with rights - power , money , honor ; those are what women are seeking , &quot; said Pestsov .
Tried them : worse .
He saw the possibility of looking men in the face again without shame , and he could live in accordance with his own habits .
There &apos;s only one thing .... What did you come to me for ?
&quot; I see something has happened .
She waited for a long while without moving , and had forgotten about him .
&quot; I have already begged you so to conduct yourself in society that even malicious tongues can find nothing to say against you .
&quot; I will swing less with my arm and more with my whole body , &quot; he thought , comparing Tit &apos;s row , which looked as if it had been cut with a line , with his own unevenly and irregularly lying grass .
Yes , he &apos;s my most serious rival , &quot; said Vronsky .
&quot; Ah , how awful !
At one moment she was horrified at this indifference , at another she rejoiced at what had brought her to this indifference .
He saw clearly that all the world and his wife expected of him something , but what exactly , he could not make out .
Vronsky glanced at her , and immediately got out of the carriage .
After filling for three years the post of president of one of the government boards at Moscow , Stepan Arkadyevitch had won the respect , as well as the liking , of his fellow @-@ officials , subordinates , and superiors , and all who had had business with him .
Your excellency won &apos;t be disturbed here , &quot; said a particularly pertinacious , white @-@ headed old Tatar with immense hips and coat @-@ tails gaping widely behind .
When the old man got up again , said his prayer , and lay down under a bush , putting some grass under his head for a pillow , Levin did the same , and in spite of the clinging flies that were so persistent in the sunshine , and the midges that tickled his hot face and body , he fell asleep at once and only waked when the sun had passed to the other side of the bush and reached him .
That force finds a certain form of activity of itself , according to the stage of its development .
&quot; Anna !
Whereabouts will she be ?
&quot; You see , your good lady &apos;s settled me here , told me to sit a bit with her , &quot; said Agafea Mihalovna , smiling affectionately at Kitty .
It is very possible that if that form does not correspond with my requirements I may give up a legal divorce . &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s always the case , &quot; said the lawyer , &quot; and that &apos;s always for you to decide . &quot; He let his eyes rest on Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s feet , feeling that he might offend his client by the sight of his irrepressible amusement .
He had expected to find him in the same state of self @-@ deception which he had heard was so frequent with the consumptive , and which had struck him so much during his brother &apos;s visit in the autumn .
Before him stood the orderly with a tray of brandy and salted cucumbers .
Those words have no meaning for me , &quot; she said in a shaking voice .
He was dissatisfied with her for being unable to make up her mind to let him go when it was necessary ( and how strange it was for him to think that he , so lately hardly daring to believe in such happiness as that she could love him - now was unhappy because she loved him too much !
&quot; That &apos;s Petrov , an artist , &quot; answered Kitty , blushing .
Sorry as Konstantin Levin was to crush down his mowing grass , he drove him into the meadow .
This evening .... &quot; He mentioned a French actress , and was going to tell something about her ; but the ambassador &apos;s wife , with playful horror , cut him short .
&quot; I beg your pardon , your excellency ; I &apos;d only just that minute gone out . &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch took the telegrams and opened them .
But though Stepan Arkadyevitch was accustomed to very different dinners , he thought everything excellent : the herb brandy , and the bread , and the butter , and above all the salt goose and the mushrooms , and the nettle soup , and the chicken in white sauce , and the white Crimean wine - everything was superb and delicious .
The conversation began amiably , but just because it was too amiable , it came to a stop again .
&quot; Come to my wife , she does so want to see you . &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch unfolded the rug in which his frozen feet were wrapped , and getting out of his carriage made his way over the snow to Darya Alexandrovna .
She had broadened out all over , and in her face at the time when she was speaking of the actress there was an evil expression of hatred that distorted it .
&quot; How wonderfully they make this soap , &quot; he said gazing at a piece of soap he was handling , which Agafea Mihalovna had put ready for the visitor but Oblonsky had not used .
&quot; Idiotic !
Don &apos;t be so severe , O moralist ! &quot; &quot; No ; all the same , what &apos;s fine in life is .... &quot; Levin hesitated - &quot; oh , I don &apos;t know .
He walked down , for a long while avoiding looking at her as at the sun , but seeing her , as one does the sun , without looking .
&quot; But I would advise you to settle the thing as soon as may be , &quot; pursued Oblonsky , filling up his glass .
Does he wish it ? &quot; &quot; I know nothing , nothing . &quot; &quot; But you said yourself that you can &apos;t endure him . &quot; &quot; No , I didn &apos;t say so .
And it &apos;s just there that Russia comes back to me most vividly , and especially the country .
Berkoot , the bull , was lying down with his ring in his lip , and seemed about to get up , but thought better of it , and only gave two snorts as they passed by him .
&quot; Is he better ? &quot; &quot; Yes , much . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s wonderful . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s nothing wonderful in it . &quot; &quot; Anyway , he &apos;s better , &quot; they said in a whisper , smiling to one another .
Having eaten some junket and lighted a cigarette , he came back to the discussion .
&quot; Have you a lot of people ?
And he said he had had to go to report on the prince &apos;s departure .
And I did try with all my soul .
&quot; Why is it you can do nothing ?
&quot; How is it you &apos;re defending him ? &quot; he said , smiling .
Her hind @-@ quarters were a little drooping , and in her fore @-@ legs , and still more in her hind @-@ legs , there was a noticeable curvature .
Everything about his face and figure , from his short @-@ cropped black hair and freshly shaven chin down to his loosely fitting , brand @-@ new uniform , was simple and at the same time elegant .
Konstantin Levin did not like such an attitude to the peasants .
She longed to look at his photograph and talk of him .
And , anxious to change the conversation , he inquired about what interested them both - the new head of Stepan Arkadyevitch &apos;s department , a man not yet old , who had suddenly been promoted to so high a position .
Either she was taking the children of a Russian family home from the springs , or fetching a shawl for a sick lady , and wrapping her up in it , or trying to interest an irritable invalid , or selecting and buying cakes for tea for someone .
&quot; Not envious , let us say , since he has _ talent _ ; but it annoys him that a wealthy man of the highest society , and a count , too ( you know they all detest a title ) , can , without any particular trouble , do as well , if not better , than he who has devoted all his life to it .
Everything in Darya Alexandrovna &apos;s house and children struck him now as by no means so charming as a little while before .
What a house , how nice it all is !
He was calm and dignified as ever , and was with his own hands holding Frou @-@ Frou by both reins , standing straight in front of her .
Possibly he might have managed to conceal his sins better from his wife if he had anticipated that the knowledge of them would have had such an effect on her .
Getting up from the seat and handing her maid a bag , she gave her little wrinkled hand to her son to kiss , and lifting his head from her hand , kissed him on the cheek .
As he walked over the soft rug towards the door , he could not help overhearing a conversation he did not want to hear .
He went to the door and closed it , then with fixed eyes and clenched teeth he went up to the table , took a revolver , looked round him , turned it to a loaded barrel , and sank into thought .
Vronsky &apos;s composure and self @-@ confidence here struck , like a scythe against a stone , upon the cold self @-@ confidence of Alexey Alexandrovitch .
&quot; That my wish coincides with your own , &quot; she finished quickly , exasperated at his talking so slowly while she knew beforehand all he would say .
He felt himself a conqueror .
Levin , shaking with sobs and unable to articulate a word , went out of the room .
She does nothing , and is perfectly satisfied . &quot; Levin , in his heart , censured this , and did not as yet understand that she was preparing for that period of activity which was to come for her when she would at once be the wife of her husband and mistress of the house , and would bear , and nurse , and bring up children .
She had still three hours to wait , and the memories of their last meeting set her blood in flame .
But before the obstacle they were approaching , Vronsky began working at the reins , anxious to avoid having to take the outer circle , and swiftly passed Mahotin just upon the declivity .
He had seen all of her in her illness , had come to know her very soul , and it seemed to him that he had never loved her till then .
We can manage very well now . &quot; &quot; Oh , well , then , I &apos;ll have a look at your cows , and if you &apos;ll allow me , I &apos;ll give directions about their food .
He could still be in time for his race , but if he went to Bryansky &apos;s he could only just be in time , and he would arrive when the whole of the court would be in their places .
&quot; She did not say we must do our lessons , but she said we were to go for a walk with Miss Hoole to grandmamma &apos;s . &quot; &quot; Well , go , Tanya , my darling .
&quot; How I should like to know what you were thinking about then !
&quot; Will the train soon be in ? &quot; Vronsky asked a railway official .
And progress in agriculture more than anything else - the potato , for instance , that was introduced among us by force .
&quot; Like the mother !
Levin meanwhile , in his trousers , but without his coat and waistcoat , was walking to and fro in his room at the hotel , continually putting his head out of the door and looking up and down the corridor .
&quot; That &apos;s our aristocracy , prince ! &quot; the Moscow colonel said with ironical intention .
Come next spring , do , &quot; said Levin .
The friend of his childhood , a man of the same set , of the same coterie , his comrade in the Corps of Pages , Serpuhovskoy , who had left school with him and had been his rival in class , in gymnastics , in their scrapes and their dreams of glory , had come back a few days before from Central Asia , where he had gained two steps up in rank , and an order rarely bestowed upon generals so young .
&quot; I &apos;ll come when you get married , &quot; said Varenka .
Levin had been the friend and companion of his early youth .
&quot; For God &apos;s sake ! &quot; he repeated , taking her hand .
Tushkevitch came in , announcing that the party were awaiting the other players to begin croquet .
He did not know that Levin was feeling as though he had grown wings .
If that &apos;s mine , I feel so exalted , so strong , that nothing can be humiliating to me .
First of all he went to the cattle .
What have I to do with Anna Pavlovna ?
Anna &apos;s emotionalism infected Dolly , and when she embraced her sister @-@ in @-@ law for the last time , she whispered : &quot; Remember , Anna , what you &apos;ve done for me - I shall never forget .
In that case , I beg you to forgive me .
shall I myself really have to say it to him ? &quot; she thought .
Levin , stopping short , was shouting at the doctor , and the doctor , too , was excited .
&quot; O the darling ! &quot; thought Vronsky .
Had it not been for them , she would have been left alone to brood over her husband who did not love her .
Would you say it &apos;s hot ? &quot; she said , stopping short in the doorway and looking inquiringly at Vronsky .
A month later Alexey Alexandrovitch was left alone with his son in his house at Petersburg , while Anna and Vronsky had gone abroad , not having obtained a divorce , but having absolutely declined all idea of one .
&quot; He &apos;s cleared it ! &quot; he thought , catching the thud of Gladiator &apos;s hoofs behind him .
Good , eh ? &quot; said he , winking .
Through love she knew all his soul , and in his soul she saw what she wanted , and that such a state of soul should be called unbelieving was to her a matter of no account .
It was just this contrast with her own position that was for Kitty the great attraction of Mademoiselle Varenka .
&quot; Here , set it here , &quot; he added angrily , and promptly seizing the vodka , he poured out a glassful and drank it greedily .
&quot; You look after him , &quot; the colonel shouted to Yashvin , pointing to Vronsky ; and he went down below to the soldiers .
Tanya behaved like a grown @-@ up person , and looked after the little ones .
In the relations of the husband and wife the same estrangement still remained , but there was no talk now of separation , and Stepan Arkadyevitch saw the possibility of explanation and reconciliation .
The waves of the sea of unconsciousness had begun to meet over his head , when all at once - it was as though a violent shock of electricity had passed over him .
&quot; Very well , then , sit down , and tell me what it &apos;s all about . &quot; And she sat down again .
Trivial as these two observations were , they perplexed her , and she had her doubts as to Madame Stahl .
&quot; You must just eat a mouthful , now , and drink only one tiny glass . &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m not hungry . &quot; &quot; There go the inseparables , &quot; Yashvin dropped , glancing sarcastically at the two officers who were at that instant leaving the room .
And the prince with surprising ease fell in with the Russian spirit , smashed trays full of crockery , sat with a gypsy girl on his knee , and seemed to be asking - what more , and does the whole Russian spirit consist in just this ?
Why , there &apos;s time one would give a month of for sixpence , and time you wouldn &apos;t give half an hour of for any money .
Do you call that a rational system ? &quot; said the landowner , obviously rather proud of the word &quot; rational . &quot; &quot; My system &apos;s very simple , &quot; said Mihail Petrovitch , &quot; thank God .
But as soon as she opened her mouth , a stream of reproach , of senseless jealousy , of all that had been torturing her during that half hour which she had spent sitting motionless at the window , burst from her .
Again he was brought face to face with that opposing force .
Even now I feel - see here , the weights on my feet , on my hands , on my fingers .
This was what had caused that strange expression of deathlike rigidity in his face which had so impressed Anna .
&quot; I cannot come , &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch said coldly , standing and not asking his visitor to sit down .
With the dying man &apos;s hand in his hand , he sat for half an hour , an hour , another hour .
His eyes followed her till her graceful figure was out of sight , and then the smile remained on his face .
She was obviously seeing nothing and no one but one man .
The officer brought the news that the rider was not killed , but the horse had broken its back .
Over the easy chair there hung in a gold frame an oval portrait of Anna , a fine painting by a celebrated artist .
The feet were cold , but the sick man was still breathing .
I was busily employed , and doing what , do you suppose ?
&quot; I have been struggling on for ever so long without doing anything , &quot; he said of his own portrait of her , &quot; and he just looked and painted it .
It &apos;s nonsense to pretend that life won &apos;t let one , that the past won &apos;t let one .
Alexey Alexandrovitch cleared his throat , and not looking at his opponent , but selecting , as he always did while he was delivering his speeches , the first person sitting opposite him , an inoffensive little old man , who never had an opinion of any sort in the Commission , began to expound his views .
Everything &apos;s lost after what has happened , everything &apos;s over ! &quot; And directly she had said this , her face suddenly softened .
Darya Alexandrovna certainly did not like this little way of Stepan Arkadyevitch &apos;s of foisting his domestic duties on others .
The intoxication of the news that Kitty was not married had gradually begun to work upon him .
Swaying rhythmically with the ambling paces of his good little cob , drinking in the warm yet fresh scent of the snow and the air , as he rode through his forest over the crumbling , wasted snow , still left in parts , and covered with dissolving tracks , he rejoiced over every tree , with the moss reviving on its bark and the buds swelling on its shoots .
&quot; Yes , I am worried sometimes ; but that will pass , if you will never talk about this .
Turovtsin - good , simple man - felt unmistakably a fish out of water , and the smile with which his thick lips greeted Stepan Arkadyevitch said , as plainly as words : &quot; Well , old boy , you have popped me down in a learned set !
It was so coarse , so unfeminine .
She was sitting on the terrace waiting for the return of her son , who had gone out for his walk and been caught in the rain .
But it was not terrible , but delightful .
It &apos;s a foolish old fashion that &apos;s kept up still , &quot; said Vronsky .
The roof was mended , a kitchen maid was found - a crony of the village elder &apos;s - hens were bought , the cows began giving milk , the garden hedge was stopped up with stakes , the carpenter made a mangle , hooks were put in the cupboards , and they ceased to burst open spontaneously , and an ironing @-@ board covered with army cloth was placed across from the arm of a chair to the chest of drawers , and there was a smell of flatirons in the maids &quot; room .
Why shouldn &apos;t it be the truth ? &quot; he thought .
She was told that he had not yet gone out , but was busy with his secretary .
&quot; But you see we manage our land without such extreme measures , &quot; said he , smiling : &quot; Levin and I and this gentleman . &quot; He indicated the other landowner .
Here was the one thing she had to do now .
everything &apos;s over with him . &quot; Chapter 30 In the little German watering @-@ place to which the Shtcherbatskys had betaken themselves , as in all places indeed where people are gathered together , the usual process , as it were , of the crystallization of society went on , assigning to each member of that society a definite and unalterable place .
The heaviness in his head and the weariness in his limbs that he had felt a minute before had suddenly gone .
With her little deft hands she opened and shut her little red bag , took out a cushion , laid it on her knees , and carefully wrapping up her feet , settled herself comfortably .
To Mihailov at that moment , excited by visitors , it was extremely distasteful to speak of money matters .
My God !
He smiled his kindly smile and said gently , &quot; Kiss your wife , and you kiss your husband , &quot; and took the candles out of their hands .
The first onslaught of jealousy , once lived through , could never come back again , and even the discovery of infidelities could never now affect her as it had the first time .
He paused near his compartment , waiting for her to get out .
&quot; You do not love him .... Leave me Seryozha ! &quot; &quot; Yes , I have lost even my affection for my son , because he is associated with the repulsion I feel for you .
The princess was distracted , and did not know what to do .
Levin got up to stop her .
The sledge @-@ drivers clearly knew all about it .
How ought I to love him ?
Towards evening Konstantin Levin went to his counting house , gave directions as to the work to be done , and sent about the village to summon the mowers for the morrow , to cut the hay in Kalinov meadow , the largest and best of his grass lands .
And before the picture of Ivanov the question arises for the believer and the unbeliever alike , &quot; Is it God , or is it not God ? &quot; and the unity of the impression is destroyed . &quot; &quot; Why so ?
The carriages , posts , people , everything that was to be seen was covered with snow on one side , and was getting more and more thickly covered .
Not one word did Stepan Arkadyevitch say in reference to Kitty and the Shtcherbatskys ; he merely gave him greetings from his wife .
A young deacon , whose long back showed in two distinct halves through his thin undercassock , met him , and at once going to a little table at the wall read the exhortation .
Come to the Vrede garden .
One , the lower class , vulgar , stupid , and , above all , ridiculous people , who believe that one husband ought to live with the one wife whom he has lawfully married ; that a girl should be innocent , a woman modest , and a man manly , self @-@ controlled , and strong ; that one ought to bring up one &apos;s children , earn one &apos;s bread , and pay one &apos;s debts ; and various similar absurdities .
Levin smiled at his own thoughts , and shook his head disapprovingly at those thoughts ; a feeling akin to remorse fretted him .
Away with weakness ! &quot; Levin rose to his feet , took off his overcoat , and scurrying over the rough ice round the hut , came out on the smooth ice and skated without effort , as it were , by simple exercise of will , increasing and slackening speed and turning his course .
At first , when they were talking of the influence that one people has on another , there rose to Levin &apos;s mind what he had to say on the subject .
They began again on the subject that had been started at dinner - the liberty and occupations of women .
Their host smiled approvingly .
He had hardly grasped what his brother was saying .
I could not look at him without feeling sorry for him .
Sergey Koznishev had been following this crusade with interest , and after reading the professor &apos;s last article , he had written him a letter stating his objections .
He &apos;s in the same style as the drawing @-@ room and that &apos;s why it is he &apos;s so often here . &quot; This conversation was maintained , since it rested on allusions to what could not be talked of in that room - that is to say , of the relations of Tushkevitch with their hostess .
When half the children had been dressed , some peasant women in holiday dress , out picking herbs , came up to the bathing @-@ shed and stopped shyly .
&quot; He &apos;s seen a great deal , anyway ; he &apos;s cultured ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s an utterly different culture - their culture .
Leaving him there to wash and change his clothes , Levin went off to the counting house to speak about the ploughing and clover .
But what always struck him in her as something unlooked for , was the expression of her eyes , soft , serene , and truthful , and above all , her smile , which always transported Levin to an enchanted world , where he felt himself softened and tender , as he remembered himself in some days of his early childhood .
&quot; You &apos;re not in bed ?
&quot; Well , I &apos;m awfully glad I &apos;ve found you !
Again came the red flash and the sound of a blow , and fluttering its wings as though trying to keep up in the air , the bird halted , stopped still an instant , and fell with a heavy splash on the slushy ground .
&quot; But she , poor girl ...
&quot; I feel I &apos;m setting off , &quot; Nikolay said with difficulty , but with extreme distinctness , screwing the words out of himself .
The colonel and Vronsky were both fully aware that Vronsky &apos;s name and rank would be sure to contribute greatly to the softening of the injured husband &apos;s feelings .
His natural feeling urged him to defend himself , to prove to her she was wrong ; but to prove her wrong would mean irritating her still more and making the rupture greater that was the cause of all his suffering .
More than that , he saw from her tone that she was not even perturbed at that , but as it were said straight out to him : &quot; Yes , it &apos;s shut up , and so it must be , and will be in future . &quot; Now he experienced a feeling such as a man might have , returning home and finding his own house locked up .
Vronsky had hardly formed the thought that he could perhaps pass on the outer side , when Frou @-@ Frou shifted her pace and began overtaking him on the other side .
It seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had gone .
Today this thought gained special poignancy from certain other considerations .
He would have run to her , but remembering that there might be spectators , he looked round towards the balcony door , and reddened a little , as he always reddened , feeling that he had to be afraid and be on his guard .
It was again that expression of reverential ecstasy which had so worked upon her the day before .
Moreover , his attitude to Kitty in the past - the attitude of a grown @-@ up person to a child , arising from his friendship with her brother - seemed to him yet another obstacle to love .
&quot; Well , how is he ?
&quot; Come , God is merciful , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; An honest man and an honest woman may be insulted , but to tell a thief he &apos;s a thief is simply _ la constatation d &apos;un fait _ . &quot; &quot; This cruelty is something new I did not know in you . &quot; &quot; You call it cruelty for a husband to give his wife liberty , giving her the honorable protection of his name , simply on the condition of observing the proprieties : is that cruelty ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s worse than cruel - it &apos;s base , if you want to know ! &quot; Anna cried , in a rush of hatred , and getting up , she was going away .
She came out from behind the door of the dressing @-@ room , and looked at him .
Well , let us be starting too , then . &quot; Princess Tverskaya did not get out of her carriage , but her groom , in high boots , a cape , and black hat , darted out at the entrance .
It was a mistake , let &apos;s admit . &quot; &quot; A fearful mistake ! &quot; said Anna .
At the question : Should they go abroad ?
But at that moment the racers started , and all conversation ceased .
I must !
Soon after the arrival of the Shtcherbatskys there appeared in the morning crowd at the springs two persons who attracted universal and unfavorable attention .
And I can &apos;t live with him !
&quot; How glad I am ! &quot; he said , squeezing his hand and drawing him on one side .
And that would be soon , he felt .
They were just going to lead her out .
But he lived with his wife on such terms that their affectionate childless home life was the admiration of everyone , and arranged his wife &apos;s life so that she did nothing and could do nothing but share her husband &apos;s efforts that her time should pass as happily and as agreeably as possible .
Reckoning over again his list of debts , Vronsky copied it , dividing it into three classes .
Her clean @-@ cut head , with prominent , bright , spirited eyes , broadened out at the open nostrils , that showed the red blood in the cartilage within .
Levin was grateful to him for his delicacy and was very glad of his visitor .
&quot; What , what is the matter ? &quot; &quot; How &apos;s Agafea Mihalovna &apos;s hand ? &quot; said Levin , slapping himself on the head .
&quot; I will say one thing , Alexey Alexandrovitch .
I meant to say ...
&quot; Because you always look nicer than anyone . &quot; Anna had the faculty of blushing .
Matthew , chapter xxvii , &quot; he said , feeling his lips were beginning to tremble with emotion .
Besides this , she was pleased to go away to the country because she was dreaming of getting her sister Kitty to stay with her there .
&quot; It &apos;s all very well for you to talk , &quot; said she , &quot; when you have I don &apos;t know how many millions ; but I am very glad when my husband goes on a revising tour in the summer .
It &apos;s delightful to look at you .
Charming !
I never could understand how it was a punishment .
yes .... Well , thank God !
I imagine that if Christ is brought down to the level of an historical character , it would have been better for Ivanov to select some other historical subject , fresh , untouched . &quot; &quot; But if this is the greatest subject presented to art ? &quot; &quot; If one looked one would find others .
But Kitty heard and saw he was ashamed and uncomfortable at being naked before her .
And leave it to me , and do what I say .
And therefore , if they want to depict , not God , but a revolutionist or a sage , let them take from history a Socrates , a Franklin , a Charlotte Corday , but not Christ .
But recollecting that his mother was waiting for him , he went back again into the carriage .
With a face full of light and thought , full of a subtle , complex inner life , that was remote from Levin , she was gazing beyond him at the glow of the sunrise .
&quot; Why you ought to know Vronsky is that he &apos;s one of your rivals . &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s Vronsky ? &quot; said Levin , and his face was suddenly transformed from the look of childlike ecstasy which Oblonsky had just been admiring to an angry and unpleasant expression .
Sviazhsky was one of those people , always a source of wonder to Levin , whose convictions , very logical though never original , go one way by themselves , while their life , exceedingly definite and firm in its direction , goes its way quite apart and almost always in direct contradiction to their convictions .
Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s departure made a great sensation , the more so as just before he started he officially returned the posting @-@ fares allowed him for twelve horses , to drive to his destination .
&quot; Why I should be lowering myself , I don &apos;t understand . &quot; &quot; Then , Masha , tell them to bring supper ; three portions , spirits and wine .... No , wait a minute .... No , it doesn &apos;t matter .... Go along . &quot; Chapter 25 &quot; So you see , &quot; pursued Nikolay Levin , painfully wrinkling his forehead and twitching .
&quot; Mamma , couldn &apos;t I speak to her ? &quot; said Kitty , watching her unknown friend , and noticing that she was going up to the spring , and that they might come there together .
&quot; Yes , my boy , there is !
&quot; You &apos;re staying the night , I hope ? &quot; was the first word the spirit of falsehood prompted her to utter ; &quot; and now we &apos;ll go together .
I have only to find the best way out of the difficult position in which she has placed me .
I should not torture myself and torture you with my jealousy .... And it will come soon , but not as we expect . &quot; And at the thought of how it would come , she seemed so pitiable to herself that tears came into her eyes , and she could not go on .
He &apos;s a remarkable portrait @-@ painter .
&quot; Mahotin ?
The worst and most tiresome part of his character , what made all relations with him so difficult , had been forgotten by Konstantin Levin when he thought of him , and now , when he saw his face , and especially that nervous twitching of his head , he remembered it all .
&quot; I ?
&quot; I &apos;m beginning to be weary of fruitlessly championing the truth , and sometimes I &apos;m quite unhinged by it .
His policy I don &apos;t know , but one thing - he &apos;s a very nice fellow , &quot; answered Stepan Arkadyevitch .
He went to the door of the partition wall , raised his hands , and hummed in French , &quot; There was a king in Thule . &quot; &quot; Vronsky , will you have a drink ? &quot; &quot; Go along , &quot; said Vronsky , putting on the coat his valet handed to him .
Yes , there were gray hairs about his temples .
&quot; Beg pardon , is the Yausky bridge done yet , or shall I have to drive around ? &quot; he asked .
Anna recognized him , and only then recalled that Vronsky had told her the day before that he would not come .
She was small @-@ boned all over ; though her chest was extremely prominent in front , it was narrow .
Stepan Arkadyevitch was disputing with Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s servant , and insisting on being announced .
&quot; Our support is love , that love that He has vouchsafed us .
The betrayed husband , who had figured till that time as a pitiful creature , an incidental and somewhat ludicrous obstacle to his happiness , had suddenly been summoned by her herself , elevated to an awe @-@ inspiring pinnacle , and on the pinnacle that husband had shown himself , not malignant , not false , not ludicrous , but kind and straightforward and large .
&quot; Well , let &apos;s be going , &quot; he said .
After a prolonged dispute the matter was decided by the peasants taking these eleven stacks , reckoning them as fifty loads each .
&quot; Dolinka , I am so , so wretched ! &quot; she whispered penitently .
&quot; You must have let in a dozen at least . &quot; Sergey Ivanovitch could not endure flies , and in his own room he never opened the window except at night , and carefully kept the door shut .
Anna looked sternly at him .
I always note them all down .
Dressed in a white gown , deeply embroidered , she was sitting in a corner of the terrace behind some flowers , and did not hear him .
And this seemed to him perfectly clear .
Hearing her husband &apos;s steps , she stopped , looking towards the door , and trying assiduously to give her features a severe and contemptuous expression .
Nodding with an air of lofty contempt to the two officers , he went up to Vronsky .
&quot; She will never speak out about it .
&quot; What a sowing , Konstantin Dmitrievitch , &quot; he said , hesitating ; &quot; first rate .
How often he had seen him come up to Moscow from the country where he was doing something , but what precisely Stepan Arkadyevitch could never quite make out , and indeed he took no interest in the matter .
A guard , either drunk or too much muffled up in the bitter frost , had not heard the train moving back , and had been crushed .
She sees right through people ; but that &apos;s not all ; she knows what will come to pass , especially in the way of marriages .
&quot; Would you like to go into my study ? &quot; Levin said in French to Stepan Arkadyevitch , scowling morosely .
&quot; Her husband put her with me , and I was delighted to have her .
&quot; It &apos;s all ever so much simpler and better .... &quot; &quot; How beautiful ! &quot; he thought , looking at the strange , as it were , mother @-@ of @-@ pearl shell of white fleecy cloudlets resting right over his head in the middle of the sky .
&quot; It &apos;ll soon be three months , and I &apos;m doing next to nothing .
&quot; she calls Mademoiselle Varenka angel number one . &quot; &quot; Oh !
And it &apos;s better it should come to nothing , if he , Vronsky , is capable of falling in love with you in a single day . &quot; &quot; Oh , heavens , that would be too silly ! &quot; said Anna , and again a deep flush of pleasure came out on her face , when she heard the idea , that absorbed her , put into words .
&quot; My _ belle @-@ sœur _ is in general too hasty . &quot; But Countess Lidia Ivanovna , though she was interested in everything that did not concern her , had a habit of never listening to what interested her ; she interrupted Anna : &quot; Yes , there &apos;s plenty of sorrow and evil in the world .
Besides this , the care of her large family was a constant worry to her : first , the nursing of her young baby did not go well , then the nurse had gone away , now one of the children had fallen ill . &quot; Well , how are all of you ? &quot; asked her mother .
I don &apos;t know .... &quot; &quot; No , she could not tell an untruth with those eyes , &quot; thought the mother , smiling at her agitation and happiness .
Is the room to be got ready upstairs ? &quot; &quot; Inform Darya Alexandrovna : where she orders . &quot; &quot; Darya Alexandrovna ? &quot; Matvey repeated , as though in doubt .
But what could she say or do ?
He cracked his knuckles and sat down , sorting out his writing appurtenances .
Then people began arriving with petitions , and there came the reports , interviews , appointments , dismissals , apportionment of rewards , pensions , grants , notes , the workaday round , as Alexey Alexandrovitch called it , that always took up so much time .
In those days Levin used often to be in the Shtcherbatskys &quot; house , and he was in love with the Shtcherbatsky household .
And why do they worry me so ?
Excuse me a minute .... &quot; A secretary came in , with respectful familiarity and the modest consciousness , characteristic of every secretary , of superiority to his chief in the knowledge of their business ; he went up to Oblonsky with some papers , and began , under pretense of asking a question , to explain some objection .
Alexey Alexandrovitch , after staying half an hour , went up to his wife and suggested that they should go home together .
My duty is clearly defined .
&quot; How good you are !
The court ? &quot; He could not come to a pause anywhere .
To Vronsky , at any rate , it seemed that she understood all he felt at that moment , looking at her .
It was not the past when he had lived happily with his wife that troubled him .
&quot; Yes , it is stupid , &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch assented , smiling soothingly .
Let the scientific men find out what the force consists in .
my God ! &quot; But neither &quot; God &quot; nor &quot; my &quot; had any meaning to her .
Sergey Ivanovitch was unequaled in his skill in winding up the most heated and serious argument by some unexpected pinch of Attic salt that changed the disposition of his opponent .
&quot; It &apos;s come ! &quot; he thought in ecstasy .
Kitty followed her .
And I used to think that , before marriage , life was nothing much , somehow didn &apos;t count , but that after marriage , life began in earnest .
&quot; She &apos;s still here , &quot; she thought .
She expected him to ask her for a waltz , but he did not , and she glanced wonderingly at him .
You &apos;re nice as you are , &quot; said Varenka , smiling her gentle , weary smile .
Her hands rose and dropped onto his shoulders .
Lili is ill , and I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s scarlatina .
&quot; Oh , no , I can &apos;t receive him ; and what object would there .... &quot; She stopped suddenly , and glanced inquiringly at her husband ( he did not look at her ) .
The sick man himself , washed and combed , lay in clean sheets on high raised pillows , in a clean night @-@ shirt with a white collar about his astoundingly thin neck , and with a new expression of hope looked fixedly at Kitty .
The little house covered with ivy , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; Yes ; that &apos;s Nastia &apos;s work , &quot; she said , indicating her sister .
&quot; These riverside banks always remind me of the riddle - do you know it ?
And everything that had been stirring Levin during that sleepless night , all the resolutions he had made , all vanished at once .
But she was not listening to his words , she was reading his thoughts from the expression of his face .
&quot; I really don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; What !
&quot; Yes , I have been wanting to tell you , &quot; she said , not looking at him .
Chapter 15 At the end of the evening Kitty told her mother of her conversation with Levin , and in spite of all the pity she felt for Levin , she was glad at the thought that she had received an _ offer _ .
&quot; I am very well ; what do I want the doctor for ? &quot; &quot; No , the little one cries , and they say the nurse hasn &apos;t enough milk . &quot; &quot; Why didn &apos;t you let me nurse her , when I begged to ?
&quot; But I say , &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch said to him one day after he had come back from the country , where he had got everything ready for the young people &apos;s arrival , &quot; have you a certificate of having been at confession ? &quot; &quot; No .
&quot; Oh , capitally !
But Levin was in love , and so it seemed to him that Kitty was so perfect in every respect that she was a creature far above everything earthly ; and that he was a creature so low and so earthly that it could not even be conceived that other people and she herself could regard him as worthy of her .
I &apos;ll show it you .
So I hope .... &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch began cheerfully .
&quot; It &apos;s in the guide @-@ book , &quot; said Golenishtchev , referring to the palazzo Vronsky had taken .
It was Tyndall &apos;s _ Treatise on Heat _ .
I can &apos;t think of you and myself apart .
The revolver was close beside him - he sought further off .
&quot; Yes , but the spiritualists say we don &apos;t know at present what this force is , but there is a force , and these are the conditions in which it acts .
That they were only sowing the clover on fifteen acres , not on all the forty @-@ five , was still more annoying to him .
He felt utterly wretched .
So let me be what I am .
I call her mamma , but I am not related to her ; I was brought up by her , &quot; answered Varenka , flushing a little again .
He felt as though some external force were moving him .
But she was not likely to be attractive to men .
Everything as it used to be ? &quot; he said .
I don &apos;t only manage my own affairs , but other people &apos;s too , &quot; he said , with a significant expression .
&quot; Where are you off to ? &quot; asked Yashvin .
You can &apos;t understand .... &quot; &quot; Oh , yes , I understand !
&quot; We &apos;ve been marrying you here .
Of the people in Petersburg the most intimate and most possible were his chief secretary and his doctor .
Sir John was there .
In the trembling circles of shadow cast by the leaves , at a table , covered with a white cloth , and set with coffeepot , bread @-@ and @-@ butter , cheese , and cold game , sat the princess in a high cap with lilac ribbons , distributing cups and bread @-@ and @-@ butter .
When he was left alone , and recalled the conversation of these bachelor friends , Levin asked himself : had he in his heart that regret for his freedom of which they had spoken ?
Please , let me ! &quot; she besought her husband , as though the happiness of her life depended on it .
Yesterday she came up to me after the races and was in despair at not finding you .
The study was slowly lit up as the candle was brought in .
&quot; Here , do you see ? ... &quot;
If to a little child or to his cook were revealed what he saw , it or she would have been able to peel the wrappings off what was seen .
But in spite of all these difficulties he got his way , and by autumn the system was working , or at least so it seemed to him .
&quot; He waked me up , damn him , and said he &apos;d look in again . &quot; And pulling up the rug he flung himself back on the pillow .
&quot; That is not and will not be , and she wants to wipe it out of her memory .
This code of principles covered only a very small circle of contingencies , but then the principles were never doubtful , and Vronsky , as he never went outside that circle , had never had a moment &apos;s hesitation about doing what he ought to do .
Sviazhsky went with him into the hall , yawning and wondering at the strange humor his friend was in .
&quot; They must certainly make a great impression on you . &quot; &quot; Oh , I should think so !
&quot; Would you like tea ? &quot; She rang .
&quot; Can it be true ? &quot; thought Levin , and he looked round at his bride .
The new drying machine had been constructed and partly invented by Levin .
what ? &quot; he asked her , squeezing her hand with his elbow , and trying to read her thoughts in her face .
His mother &apos;s attempt to buy him stung him to the quick and made him feel colder than ever to her .
And , in spite of his absurd position as Liza &apos;s lovesick swain at his age , you ought to see how he carries off the absurd position .
Chapter 28 Levin was insufferably bored that evening with the ladies ; he was stirred as he had never been before by the idea that the dissatisfaction he was feeling with his system of managing his land was not an exceptional case , but the general condition of things in Russia ; that the organization of some relation of the laborers to the soil in which they would work , as with the peasant he had met half @-@ way to the Sviazhskys , &quot; was not a dream , but a problem which must be solved .
What ? ...
But it &apos;s not ended yet ... and it will have a fearful end . &quot; &quot; No matter , we must let the string be loosened , little by little .
I am proud of my position , because ... proud of being ... proud .... &quot; She could not say what she was proud of .
They had cut the whole of the big meadow , which had , in the years of serf labor , taken thirty scythes two days to mow .
But it was very difficult for him not to say more , to tell her nothing but that .
She could not listen to them and take them in , so strong was the one feeling that filled her breast and grew stronger and stronger .
I only meant to be matchmaking , and all at once it turned out quite differently .
&quot; My God , how light it is !
&quot; For Alexey - I am speaking of Alexey Alexandrovitch ( what a strange and awful thing that both are Alexey , isn &apos;t it ?
And I can &apos;t and won &apos;t knowingly make a pretense about it . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re incorrigible , &quot; said Stremov , not looking at her , and he spoke again to Anna .
He was not in the least interested in what he said himself , and even less so in what they said ; all he wanted was that they and everyone should be happy and contented .
Levin kept between them .
Two things caused him anguish : his lack of purity and his lack of faith .
Frou @-@ Frou , excited and over @-@ nervous , had lost the first moment , and several horses had started before her , but before reaching the stream , Vronsky , who was holding in the mare with all his force as she tugged at the bridle , easily overtook three , and there were left in front of him Mahotin &apos;s chestnut Gladiator , whose hind @-@ quarters were moving lightly and rhythmically up and down exactly in front of Vronsky , and in front of all , the dainty mare Diana bearing Kuzovlev more dead than alive .
He had obviously prepared the sentence beforehand .
She was delighted , and so confused at her own delight that there was a moment , the moment when he went up to her sister and glanced again at her , when she , and he , and Dolly , who saw it all , thought she would break down and would begin to cry .
You care about farming , hunting , - well , you &apos;d better look out ! &quot; &quot; Arhip was here today ; he said there were a lot of elks in Prudno , and two bears , &quot; said Tchirikov .
You &apos;ve time to think things over , and no hurry . &quot; &quot; But time &apos;s money , you forget that , &quot; said the colonel .
The maid took a handbag and the lap dog , the butler and a porter the other baggage .
The friends glanced at one another , and a look of hesitation came into both faces , as though Golenishtchev , unmistakably admiring her , would have liked to say something about her , and could not find the right thing to say , while Vronsky desired and dreaded his doing so .
Such men as you are wanted . &quot; &quot; By whom ? &quot; &quot; By whom ?
He recalled particularly vividly the shame he had more than once detected in her at this necessity for lying and deceit .
&quot; You &apos;re encroaching on Princess Myakaya &apos;s special domain now .
&quot; Well , my dear , so you took the olive branch ? &quot; inquired Countess Lidia Ivanovna , as soon as she came into the room .
His face relaxed , his lips swelled , his eyes were swimming with tears .
A roll of unfolded notes done up in a wrapper fell out of it .
If she wishes to see you , I will let you know , but now I suppose it would be better for you to go away . &quot; He got up , and sobs cut short his words .
And really , one does so little harm to anyone , and gives oneself so much pleasure .... &quot; &quot; What !
Now , in our own day , we landowners in the serf times used various improvements in our husbandry : drying machines and thrashing machines , and carting manure and all the modern implements - all that we brought into use by our authority , and the peasants opposed it at first , and ended by imitating us .
They were rubbing each other .
Shall I see him today ? &quot; she was thinking .
&quot; If so , I beg your pardon . &quot; &quot; No , you were not mistaken , &quot; she said deliberately , looking desperately into his cold face .
Oblonsky !
Russia has been ruined by the emancipation ! &quot; Sviazhsky looked with smiling eyes at Levin , and even made a faint gesture of irony to him ; but Levin did not think the landowner &apos;s words absurd , he understood them better than he did Sviazhsky .
&quot; And the something turned round , and I saw it was a peasant with a disheveled beard , little , and dreadful looking .
She glanced round for an instant , looked inquiringly at him , and with a slight frown turned away again .
There was no one in the church but a beggar soldier , two old women , and the church officials .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand what you are doing , &quot; said Levin , shrugging his shoulders .
So indeed it seemed to Vronsky .
There was an interval of hesitation , whispering , and smiles ; but the expression of solemn emotion on the faces of the betrothed pair did not change : on the contrary , in their perplexity over their hands they looked more grave and deeply moved than before , and the smile with which Stepan Arkadyevitch whispered to them that now they would each put on their own ring died away on his lips .
But he was not aware that he sought work for himself that year , that this was one of the means for keeping shut that secret place where lay hid his feelings towards his wife and son and his thoughts about them , which became more terrible the longer they lay there .
&quot; Ah , that &apos;s a new trick ! &quot; said Levin , and he promptly ran up to the top to do this new trick .
&quot; Well , sir , are you going to Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky ?
I say it in a whisper ... but doesn &apos;t it really make everything clear ?
Vronsky was at the head of the race , just as he wanted to be and as Cord had advised , and now he felt sure of being the winner .
&quot; What is it , Anna ? &quot; he asked , when they had driven a few hundred yards .
Levin could see the scanty locks wet with sweat on the temples and tense , transparent @-@ looking forehead .
And strange it was that they were actually talking of how absurd Ivan Ivanovitch was with his French , and how the Eletsky girl might have made a better match , yet these words had all the while consequence for them , and they were feeling just as Kitty did .
He got up and submissively followed her to the schoolroom .
To go on being my husband together with her ... it &apos;s awful !
Why are you so red ? &quot; her mother and father said to her with one voice .
He had a ready appreciation of art , and probably , with a taste for imitating art , he supposed himself to have the real thing essential for an artist , and after hesitating for some time which style of painting to select - religious , historical , realistic , or genre painting - he set to work to paint .
&quot; There are two aspects , &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch resumed : &quot; those who take part and those who look on ; and love for such spectacles is an unmistakable proof of a low degree of development in the spectator , I admit , but .... &quot; &quot; Princess , bets ! &quot; sounded Stepan Arkadyevitch &apos;s voice from below , addressing Betsy .
The excited mare , trying to shake off her rider first on one side and then the other , pulled at the reins , and Vronsky tried in vain with voice and hand to soothe her .
Anna took out the presents Dolly &apos;s children had sent him , and told her son what sort of little girl was Tanya at Moscow , and how Tanya could read , and even taught the other children .
For the first time he pictured vividly to himself her personal life , her ideas , her desires , and the idea that she could and should have a separate life of her own seemed to him so alarming that he made haste to dispel it .
And then she knew their home would be in the country , and she wanted to go , not abroad where she was not going to live , but to the place where their home would be .
How I remember the arbor and the seat !
To Konstantin the peasant was simply the chief partner in their common labor , and in spite of all the respect and the love , almost like that of kinship , he had for the peasant - sucked in probably , as he said himself , with the milk of his peasant nurse - still as a fellow @-@ worker with him , while sometimes enthusiastic over the vigor , gentleness , and justice of these men , he was very often , when their common labors called for other qualities , exasperated with the peasant for his carelessness , lack of method , drunkenness , and lying .
Just as she was leaving the drawing @-@ room , a ring was heard in the hall .
He put this riddle into two or three different ways .
Kitty saw that her father had meant to make fun of Varenka , but that he could not do it because he liked her .
&quot; Betsy &apos;s been telling me that Count Vronsky wants to come here to say good @-@ bye before his departure for Tashkend . &quot; She did not look at her husband , and was evidently in haste to have everything out , however hard it might be for her .
Levin straightened himself , and drawing a deep breath looked round .
In both cases the conditions of agriculture are firmly established ; but among us now , when everything has been turned upside down and is only just taking shape , the question what form these conditions will take is the one question of importance in Russia , &quot; thought Levin .
No ; do tell me how you manage never to be bored ? &quot; she said , addressing Anna again .
But he had no difficulty in finding what was good and attractive in Vronsky .
It must be admitted that the latter case is rarely met with in practice , &quot; said the lawyer , and stealing a glance at Alexey Alexandrovitch he paused , as a man selling pistols , after enlarging on the advantages of each weapon , might await his customer &apos;s choice .
Always the same thing .
And long afterwards , when he was talking of other things , he broke out into his healthy laugh , showing his strong , close rows of teeth , when he thought of the helmet .
&quot; I know if one were to listen to you , &quot; interrupted the princess , &quot; we should never marry our daughter .
His brother offered to lend him money , as he would have so many expenses , presents to give .... &quot; Oh , are presents wanted ? &quot; And he galloped to Foulde &apos;s .
A vague sense of the order into which his affairs had been brought , a vague recollection of the friendliness and flattery of Serpuhovskoy , who had considered him a man that was needed , and most of all , the anticipation of the interview before him - all blended into a general , joyous sense of life .
The princess had at first been quite certain that that evening had settled Kitty &apos;s future , and that there could be no doubt of Vronsky &apos;s intentions , but her husband &apos;s words had disturbed her .
On the contrary , he needed occupation and distraction quite apart from his love , so as to recruit and rest himself from the violent emotions that agitated him .
I often wonder why people are all in league to spoil me .
&quot; No , wait a minute .
But , like all men , he forgot that she too would want work .
&quot; I got tired of it , Agafea Mihalovna .
Delighted to see you ! &quot; he said in a tone clearly indicating that he was annoyed by it .
He earthed up his potatoes with a modern plough borrowed from a neighboring landowner .
&quot; Oh , but it &apos;s a promise .
Talking about common acquaintances in Petersburg , Anna got up quickly .
And Korney said to me : &quot; In childbirth you &apos;ll die , ma &apos;am , you &apos;ll die .... &quot; And I woke up . &quot; &quot; What nonsense , what nonsense ! &quot; said Vronsky ; but he felt himself that there was no conviction in his voice .
She did not say what she had said the evening before to her lover , that _ he _ was her husband , and her husband was superfluous ; she did not even think that .
Moreover , the recollection of the rejection and the part he had played in the affair tortured him with shame .
Now for the first time he heard her words with pleasure , and did not inwardly oppose them .
To be sure !
But , there , you &apos;ve a gift for it , &quot; added Levin .
The hurried , creaking steps of his servant coming through the drawing @-@ room brought him to his senses .
And its being me , Kostya Levin , who went to a ball in a black tie , and was refused by the Shtcherbatskaya girl , and who was intrinsically such a pitiful , worthless creature - that proves nothing ; I feel sure Franklin felt just as worthless , and he too had no faith in himself , thinking of himself as a whole .
And the fact is , I certainly do love cuttlefish . &quot; &quot; But that &apos;s no hindrance to your loving your wife . &quot; &quot; The cuttlefish is no hindrance .
&quot; I never longed so for the country , Russian country , with bast shoes and peasants , as when I was spending a winter with my mother in Nice .
Levin , getting his provisions out of his carriage , invited the old man to take tea with him .
&quot; Ugh , these gentlefolks ! &quot; he said to the clerk .
&quot; You &apos;re not angry that I sent for you ?
They haven &apos;t an idea of what happiness is ; they don &apos;t know that without our love , for us there is neither happiness nor unhappiness - no life at all , &quot; he thought .
One dream haunted her almost every night .
&quot; Merciful heavens , Tanya !
There was no position in which he was not in pain , there was not a minute in which he was unconscious of it , not a limb , not a part of his body that did not ache and cause him agony .
&quot; Just see , now , and you were quite in despair , &quot; said Marya Philimonovna , pointing to the ironing @-@ board .
&quot; It &apos;s splendid as exercise , only you &apos;ll hardly be able to stand it , &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch , without a shade of irony .
I too am suffering , and shall suffer ; I am losing what I prized above everything - I am losing my good name and my son .
She said she was going to the wise woman ; her boy had screaming fits , so she was taking him to be doctored .
When at last he had taken the bride &apos;s hand in the correct way , the priest walked a few paces in front of them and stopped at the lectern .
Karenin &apos;s fixed , dull eyes were fastened upon Vronsky &apos;s face .
To forget ! &quot; he repeated to himself .
She said to herself : &quot; No , just now I can &apos;t think of it , later on , when I am calmer . &quot; But this calm for thought never came ; every time the thought rose of what she had done and what would happen to her , and what she ought to do , a horror came over her and she drove those thoughts away .
From the date of their conversation after the party at Princess Tverskaya &apos;s he had never spoken again to Anna of his suspicions and his jealousies , and that habitual tone of his bantering mimicry was the most convenient tone possible for his present attitude to his wife .
The scent of brilliantine on his whiskers struck him as particularly pleasant in the fresh air .
He was only afraid his brother might ask him some question which would make it evident he had not heard .
Tea in the little dining @-@ room , please , &quot; she said , half closing her eyes , as she always did when addressing the footman .
She tried to begin , and all at once burst into tears , and rushed out of the room .
And since she had not the slightest doubt that it was her duty to help him , she had no doubt either that it was possible , and immediately set to work .
I &apos;ve heard all that ; but , excuse me , do you know all that &apos;s been done in Europe on the question of the organization of labor ? &quot; &quot; No , very little . &quot; &quot; That question is now absorbing the best minds in Europe .
You could have been free .
He knew that Madame Karenina was there , and Betsy , and his brother &apos;s wife , and he purposely did not go near them for fear of something distracting his attention .
if everyone were as sensitive as you are ! &quot; said Varenka .
Consequently Stepan Arkadyevitch deemed it his duty to call upon him in his non @-@ official dress .
&quot; Could you cut Mashkin Upland too ? - what do you think ? &quot; he said to the old man .
Levin jumped up , and with a peremptory whisper made her go out .
I can &apos;t suffer alone , &quot; he said with despair in his voice , standing before her and looking imploringly into her eyes .
Only it &apos;s melancholy , very melancholy here .
&quot; What nonsense ! &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch .
In the left corner of the ballroom she saw the cream of society gathered together .
He stuck to it that the Russian peasant is a swine and likes swinishness , and that to get him out of his swinishness one must have authority , and there is none ; one must have the stick , and we have become so liberal that we have all of a sudden replaced the stick that served us for a thousand years by lawyers and model prisons , where the worthless , stinking peasant is fed on good soup and has a fixed allowance of cubic feet of air .
A nervous young man , a clerk in a law court , sitting opposite him , hated him for that look .
&quot; Anna , &quot; he said , with reproachful tenderness .
Kitty too felt the same thing .
&quot; What ? &quot; said Vronsky angrily , making a wry face of disgust , and showing his even teeth .
I &apos;ve told you , and I say it again , that I have some pride , and never , _ never _ would I do as you &apos;re doing - go back to a man who &apos;s deceived you , who has cared for another woman .
He doesn &apos;t give it to her .
He enjoyed the slight ache in his strong leg , he enjoyed the muscular sensation of movement in his chest as he breathed .
Anna smiled , and her smile was reflected by him .
I live quite independently of him . &quot; &quot; Yes , but say what you like , you will have to choose between me and him , &quot; he said , looking timidly into his brother &apos;s face .
But Kitty thought , and felt , and acted quite differently .
That now , having expiated his sin against the husband , he was bound to renounce her , and never in future to stand between her with her repentance and her husband , he had firmly decided in his heart ; but he could not tear out of his heart his regret at the loss of her love , he could not erase from his memory those moments of happiness that he had so little prized at the time , and that haunted him in all their charm .
She still continued to tell herself that she should leave him , but she was conscious that this was impossible ; it was impossible because she could not get out of the habit of regarding him as her husband and loving him .
You look down on this , and you &apos;re welcome to , - and go away , in God &apos;s name go away ! &quot; he shrieked , getting up from his chair .
And besides , &quot; she said hurriedly , with difficulty repressing a smile , &quot; it &apos;s really time to be in bed . &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed , and , without saying more , went into the bedroom .
At each turn in his walk , especially at the parquet of the lighted dining @-@ room , he halted and said to himself , &quot; Yes , this I must decide and put a stop to ; I must express my view of it and my decision . &quot; And he turned back again .
Darya Alexandrovna regarded staying in the country for the summer as essential for the children , especially for the little girl , who had not succeeded in regaining her strength after the scarlatina , and also as a means of escaping the petty humiliations , the little bills owing to the wood @-@ merchant , the fishmonger , the shoemaker , which made her miserable .
Then a carriage had to be sent for the best man , and another that would take Sergey Ivanovitch away would have to be sent back ....
An invalid lady had already lain down to sleep .
What answer will you make him when the innocent babe asks you : &quot; Papa !
The chief secretary of his department and his private secretary were aware of this , and used to warn women who came with petitions on no account to give way to tears , if they did not want to ruin their chances .
&quot; At home ? &quot; &quot; Sure to be at home . &quot; The door of No .
The first row , as Levin noticed , Tit had mowed specially quickly , probably wishing to put his master to the test , and the row happened to be a long one .
Stepan Arkadyevitch , who had long known that Levin was in love with his sister @-@ in @-@ law , Kitty , gave a hardly perceptible smile , and his eyes sparkled merrily .
Sergey Ivanovitch laughed outright a merry laugh , which was rare with him .
&quot; Yes , they draw away all the sap and give a false appearance of prosperity , &quot; he muttered , stopping to write , and , feeling that she was looking at him and smiling , he looked round .
&quot; What business is it of theirs ?
&quot; She understands it all better than any of us .
Marya Philimonovna called one of them and handed her a sheet and a shirt that had dropped into the water for her to dry them , and Darya Alexandrovna began to talk to the women .
&quot; It &apos;s like this , you see : I &apos;m in a fortunate position , &quot; she began , quite serious now , as she took up her cup .
Standing still , and looking at the tops of the aspen trees waving in the wind , with their freshly washed , brightly shining leaves in the cold sunshine , she knew that they would not forgive her , that everyone and everything would be merciless to her now as was that sky , that green .
Then relations arrived , and there began that state of blissful absurdity from which Levin did not emerge till the day after his wedding .
Think of her !
She dreamed that both were her husbands at once , that both were lavishing caresses on her .
&quot; To do good , probably , &quot; said the prince with a twinkle in his eye .
&quot; My words must make a deep impression on you , since you remember them so well , &quot; said Levin , and , suddenly conscious that he had said just the same thing before , he reddened .
She will be so glad to see you .
But at the same time she knew how easy it is , with the freedom of manners of today , to turn a girl &apos;s head , and how lightly men generally regard such a crime .
And the most experienced and adroit painter could not by mere mechanical facility paint anything if the lines of the subject were not revealed to him first .
The bent shadow of a man glided by at her feet , and she heard sounds of a hammer upon iron .
Not he , but she , was confused .
In the church there was no one but the peasants , the servants and their women @-@ folk .
&quot; What is it they &apos;re so pleased with ? &quot; thought Mihailov .
&quot; I &apos;ve come on purpose this evening , knowing I should meet you .
Going into the porter &apos;s room , Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced at the letters and papers brought from his office , and directed that they should be brought to him in his study .
Even more than his mare , Vronsky longed to see Gladiator , whom he had never seen .
All I know is that we shall soon be dead . &quot; &quot; Why so soon ? &quot; &quot; And do you know , there &apos;s less charm in life , when one thinks of death , but there &apos;s more peace . &quot; &quot; On the contrary , the finish is always the best .
They see our friend standing there . &quot; ( Petritsky mimicked how he was standing with the helmet . )
No , no , promise ! ... &quot; &quot; I promise everything , but I can &apos;t be at peace , especially after what you have told me .
&quot; About the Karenins .
But to the prince the brightness and gaiety of the June morning , and the sound of the orchestra playing a gay waltz then in fashion , and above all , the appearance of the healthy attendants , seemed something unseemly and monstrous , in conjunction with these slowly moving , dying figures gathered together from all parts of Europe .
Choosing a time when her daughter had gone to the spring , while Varenka had stopped outside the baker &apos;s , the princess went up to her .
She avoided her serious @-@ minded friends , and went out into the fashionable world .
He not only disliked family life , but a family , and especially a husband was , in accordance with the views general in the bachelor world in which he lived , conceived as something alien , repellant , and , above all , ridiculous .
The families of the Levins and the Shtcherbatskys were old , noble Moscow families , and had always been on intimate and friendly terms .
If his wife had then , on declaring to him her unfaithfulness , left him , he would have been wounded , unhappy , but he would not have been in the hopeless position - incomprehensible to himself - in which he felt himself now .
In the discussions that arose between the brothers on their views of the peasantry , Sergey Ivanovitch always got the better of his brother , precisely because Sergey Ivanovitch had definite ideas about the peasant - his character , his qualities , and his tastes .
&quot; See , now , &quot; said Katavasov , drawling his words from a habit acquired in the lecture @-@ room , &quot; what a capable fellow was our friend Konstantin Dmitrievitch .
She walked with smart little steps in high @-@ heeled shoes , and shook hands with the ladies vigorously like a man .
&quot; Oh , what nonsense ! &quot; Anna went on , not seeing her husband .
&quot; How wonderfully sweet she is ! &quot; she said , gazing at Varenka just as she handed a glass to the Frenchwoman .
Wait a bit ; where are they ? &quot; Vronsky stopped .
I like that so ; to see him condescending !
Only the day before she had told him that she was with child .
The princess was the first to put everything into words , and to translate all thoughts and feelings into practical questions .
&quot; And when is your next ball ? &quot; she asked Kitty .
&quot; Forgive you ?
Everything was made bright by her .
&quot; Yes , yes . &quot; And still stroking her little shoulder , he kissed her on the roots of her hair and neck , and let her go .
She thought of that other ; she pictured him , and felt how her heart was flooded with emotion and guilty delight at the thought of him .
But today he was resolved to have it out .
On reaching the French theater , Vronsky retired to the foyer with the colonel , and reported to him his success , or non @-@ success .
He was angry with him for galloping past and exciting his mare .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid will die this minute . &quot; Both of them ran to him .
&quot; I &apos;m very glad you &apos;re at home .
He called indeed to Katya , as he called her .
In reality he had ceased to enjoy himself as long ago as the year before , when he went away to Moscow .
But I &apos;ll draw him out .
She was sewing at _ broderie anglaise _ .
&quot; I &apos;m just going now , and I shall have to keep in and you won &apos;t be able to come to see me , &quot; said Dolly , sitting down beside her .
&quot; What do you wish of me ? &quot; he said simply and seriously .
When he went to her , she was sobbing .
There was nothing for it but to submit , since , although all the doctors had studied in the same school , had read the same books , and learned the same science , and though some people said this celebrated doctor was a bad doctor , in the princess &apos;s household and circle it was for some reason accepted that this celebrated doctor alone had some special knowledge , and that he alone could save Kitty .
&quot; Now I will enter upon my duties , &quot; she said with a smile after a pause , as she wiped away the traces of tears .
He had one arm on the window of a carriage that was stopping at the corner , and out of the window were thrust the heads of a lady in a velvet hat , and two children .
After dinner the two young men go into their host &apos;s study , and write a letter to the unknown fair one .
Levin told his brother that his wife had come with him .
Chapter 17 The hotel of the provincial town where Nikolay Levin was lying ill was one of those provincial hotels which are constructed on the newest model of modern improvements , with the best intentions of cleanliness , comfort , and even elegance , but owing to the public that patronizes them , are with astounding rapidity transformed into filthy taverns with a pretension of modern improvement that only makes them worse than the old @-@ fashioned , honestly filthy hotels .
Chapter 2 When he got home , Vronsky found there a note from Anna .
Where the land with serf @-@ labor and good management gave a yield of nine to one , on the half @-@ crop system it yields three to one .
28 ! &quot; several different voices shouted again , and muffled figures ran by covered with snow .
&quot; He &apos;s no good either , &quot; he said .
He &apos;s so good he doesn &apos;t know himself how good he is .
&quot; You know his weakness for balls , and he never misses a single court ball .
At midnight the patient lay without consciousness , and almost without pulse .
&quot; That was what I did indeed when she herself made known to me my humiliation ; I left everything as of old .
I should have nothing more to tell you . &quot; &quot; Oh , no , &quot; said the countess , taking her hand .
About all the rest there might be a doubt , but the velvet was delicious .
She leaped up from her chair , and flinging her clasp on the ground , she gesticulated rapidly with her hands and said : &quot; Why bring Levin in too ?
She felt crushed .
Stepan Arkadyevitch &apos;s eyes twinkled gaily , and he pondered with a smile .
And she &apos;s on your side . &quot; &quot; How do you mean ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not only that she likes you - she says that Kitty is certain to be your wife . &quot; At these words Levin &apos;s face suddenly lighted up with a smile , a smile not far from tears of emotion .
Turn him over , it &apos;s so disagreeable calling the servants .
And the worst of it all is that she &apos;s already ... it seems as if ill @-@ luck would have it so !
She was in an agony of terror for Vronsky , but a still greater agony was the never @-@ ceasing , as it seemed to her , stream of her husband &apos;s shrill voice with its familiar intonations .
&quot; You teach in it yourself ? &quot; asked Levin , trying to look above the open neck , but feeling that wherever he looked in that direction he should see it .
Heavens , how he &apos;s grown ! &quot; said Anna ; and kissing him , never taking her eyes off Dolly , she stood still and flushed a little .
You &apos;ve got everything you like .
There you have technique , &quot; he said , addressing Golenishtchev , alluding to a conversation between them about Vronsky &apos;s despair of attaining this technique .
&quot; Dolly ! &quot; he said , sobbing now ; &quot; for mercy &apos;s sake , think of the children ; they are not to blame !
Alexey Alexandrovitch walked into the hall where the sitting was held , greeted the members and the president , as usual , and sat down in his place , putting his hand on the papers laid ready before him .
But all these were secret dreams , of which Kitty did not talk either to her mother or to Varenka .
He did not want to see , and did not see , that many people in society cast dubious glances on his wife ; he did not want to understand , and did not understand , why his wife had so particularly insisted on staying at Tsarskoe , where Betsy was staying , and not far from the camp of Vronsky &apos;s regiment .
&quot; That &apos;s as you like . &quot; &quot; Mamma , why shouldn &apos;t father come with us ? &quot; said Kitty .
&quot; Yes , I shan &apos;t be able to forgive him if he does not realize all the gravity of it .
Isn &apos;t that so , Katinka ?
&quot; What am I to say to her ?
On the day when in the drawing @-@ room of the house in Arbaty Street she had gone up to him in her brown dress , and given herself to him without a word - on that day , at that hour , there took place in her heart a complete severance from all her old life , and a quite different , new , utterly strange life had begun for her , while the old life was actually going on as before .
Awkward as it was for Levin to withdraw now , it would still have been easier for him to perpetrate this awkwardness than to remain all the evening and see Kitty , who glanced at him now and then and avoided his eyes .
&quot; I must think what to do .
But from the look in her face , that suddenly brightened into its old beauty , he saw that if she did not desire this , it was simply because it seemed to her unattainable happiness .
&quot; I like even your horrid Soden for making you so well again .
An agreement had been made with the old servant , and on the road the bailiff had learned that everywhere the corn was still standing in the fields , so that his one hundred and sixty shocks that had not been carried were nothing in comparison with the losses of others .
&quot; Though it &apos;s a pity to take him from his work ( but he has plenty of time !
All one has to do is not spoil children , not to distort their nature , and they &apos;ll be delightful .
And then , he has deceived her so horribly . &quot; It was too terrible for the princess to think how she had sinned against her daughter , and she broke out angrily .
The celebrated doctor listened to him , and in the middle of his sentence looked at his big gold watch .
And thereupon , at those words , the prince had all at once flown into a passion , and began to use unseemly language .
She felt she had sinned against Kitty .
When the three @-@ mile steeplechase was beginning , she bent forward and gazed with fixed eyes at Vronsky as he went up to his horse and mounted , and at the same time she heard that loathsome , never @-@ ceasing voice of her husband .
He merely saw the outward symptoms .
But I have nothing very particular , only a few words to say , and a question I want to ask you , and we can have a talk afterwards . &quot; &quot; Well , say the few words , then , at once , and we &apos;ll gossip after dinner . &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s this , &quot; said Levin ; &quot; but it &apos;s of no importance , though . &quot; His face all at once took an expression of anger from the effort he was making to surmount his shyness .
He drove up to the steps .
Left alone with Marya Nikolaevna , Levin turned to her .
At the same moment as she entered , Vronsky &apos;s footman , with side @-@ whiskers combed out like a _ Kammerjunker _ , went in too .
The people are poor and ignorant - that we see as surely as the peasant woman sees the baby is ill because it screams .
&quot; No , that one was better ... where is it ? &quot; He went back to his wife , and scowling , and not looking at her , asked his eldest little girl , where was that piece of paper he had given them ?
&quot; &quot; Eh , you love another man , and have entered into criminal intrigues with him ? &quot; &quot; ( Mimicking her husband , she threw an emphasis on the word &quot; criminal , &quot; as Alexey Alexandrovitch did . )
Vassily Fedorovitch , isn &apos;t she splendid ? &quot; he said to the bailiff , quite forgiving him for the buckwheat under the influence of his delight in the calf .
For the first instant Alexey Alexandrovitch seemed , as it were , appalled at his own snoring , and ceased ; but after an interval of two breathings the snore sounded again , with a new tranquil rhythm .
Anna Arkadyevna still ill .... &quot; said the nurse discontentedly .
&quot; I &apos;ll put it in . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ll spoil it ! &quot; &quot; No , I won &apos;t spoil it !
Vronsky , standing beside Oblonsky , watched the carriages and the passengers , totally oblivious of his mother .
&quot; It &apos;s all right , sir , it &apos;ll spring up again , &quot; responded Vassily .
He even referred to Sergey Ivanovitch without rancor .
On reaching the house he turned his head to her , still with the same expression .
&quot; What do you want ? &quot; she cried .
They resolved to go to Russia , to the country .
Who &apos;s that ? &quot; Kitty mentioned the names of all the people they met , with some of whom she was acquainted and some not .
Any remark , the most insignificant , that showed that the critic saw even the tiniest part of what he saw in the picture , agitated him to the depths of his soul .
&quot; Oh , well , everything presents itself to me , in the coarsest , most loathsome light , &quot; she went on .
He asked her how she was , and how she had spent the morning .
Alexey Alexandrovitch had plenty of people whom he could invite to dinner , to whose sympathy he could appeal in any public affair he was concerned about , whose interest he could reckon upon for anyone he wished to help , with whom he could candidly discuss other people &apos;s business and affairs of state .
I begin to lose hope . &quot; &quot; Why , whatever hope can you have ? &quot; said Betsy , offended on behalf of her friend .
Levin &apos;s appearance at the beginning of the winter , his frequent visits , and evident love for Kitty , had led to the first serious conversations between Kitty &apos;s parents as to her future , and to disputes between them .
Kitty tried in every possible way to relieve him , to soothe him ; but it was all in vain , and Levin saw that she herself was exhausted both physically and morally , though she would not admit it .
On reaching the copse , Levin got out of the trap and led Oblonsky to a corner of a mossy , swampy glade , already quite free from snow .
Without even asking her if she cared to dance , he put out his arm to encircle her slender waist .
The whole day long there was fever , delirium , and unconsciousness .
Knowing perfectly well beforehand that the matter would never come to real danger , it would amount to my simply trying to gain a certain sham reputation by such a challenge .
The footman , though a young man , and one of the new school of footmen , a dandy , was a very kind @-@ hearted , good fellow , and he too knew all about it .
His mother had several times taken his hand from it , but the fat little hand went back to the button again .
Fortifying yourself for your work ? &quot; said the plump officer , sitting down beside him .
Konstantin Levin felt that there was no course open to him but to submit , or to confess to a lack of zeal for the public good .
Oh , if I &apos;d been in his place , I &apos;d long ago have killed , have torn to pieces a wife like me .
I ought to speak plainly to her . &quot; And everything that he would say tonight to his wife took clear shape in Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s head .
He had only to recall his brother &apos;s wife , to remember how that sweet , delightful Varya sought , at every convenient opportunity , to remind him that she remembered his generosity and appreciated it , to grasp the impossibility of taking back his gift .
&quot; Madame Karenina &apos;s a splendid woman .
Chapter 16 On the way home Levin asked all details of Kitty &apos;s illness and the Shtcherbatskys &quot; plans , and though he would have been ashamed to admit it , he was pleased at what he heard .
Of course , I &apos;m an ignorant outsider ; but I should fancy theory and its application will have its influence on the laborer too . &quot; &quot; Yes , but wait a bit .
And his brother , who was in command of one of the most expensive regiments , and was only just married , could not decline the gift .
Soon , soon , all will be over , and we shall all , all be at peace , and suffer no more . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand , &quot; he said , understanding her .
You know to me all women are divided into two classes ... at least no ... truer to say : there are women and there are ... I &apos;ve never seen exquisite fallen beings , and I never shall see them , but such creatures as that painted Frenchwoman at the counter with the ringlets are vermin to my mind , and all fallen women are the same . &quot; &quot; But the Magdalen ? &quot; &quot; Ah , drop that !
And then - I thought over our conversation yesterday . &quot; &quot; Eh !
&quot; Well , I &apos;m very , very glad to see you , &quot; said Levin , with a genuine smile of childlike delight .
Mihailov was greatly perturbed , but he could say nothing in defense of his own idea .
&quot; Yes , yes ! &quot; answered Levin .
I had something to eat there .
&quot; Daryalov , Poltavsky , Prince Karibanov , Count Paskudin , Dram ....
Yes , come along , &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch , smiling .
He saw where his boat leaked , but he did not look for the leak , perhaps purposely deceiving himself .
And my fault !
Levin looked more attentively at Ivan Parmenov and his wife .
In spite of his feeling of pride and , as it were , of the return of youth , with his favorite daughter on his arm , he felt awkward , and almost ashamed of his vigorous step and his sturdy , stout limbs .
Levin untied his horse and rode home to his coffee .
The attachment he felt to Anna precluded in his heart every need of intimate relations with others .
It &apos;s the great misfortune of our government - this paper administration , of which he &apos;s a worthy representative . &quot; &quot; Really , I don &apos;t know what fault one could find with him .
&quot; Anita !
Do you know ? &quot; Levin got up from his chair , as though on the point of starting off at once .
Possibly you are right too , that action founded on material interest would be more desirable .
how well we got on !
Having completed this task , Alexey Alexandrovitch wrote the letter to the lawyer .
She felt terrified at the disgrace , of which she had not ever thought before .
Alexey Alexandrovitch only just managed to be back by five o &apos;clock , his dinner @-@ hour , and after dining with his secretary , he invited him to drive with him to his country villa and to the races .
Three haven &apos;t turned up .
Stepan Arkadyevitch had gone down to his room , undressed , again washed , and attired in a nightshirt with goffered frills , he had got into bed , but Levin still lingered in his room , talking of various trifling matters , and not daring to ask what he wanted to know .
Just such a distasteful sensation was what Mihailov felt at the sight of Vronsky &apos;s painting : he felt it both ludicrous and irritating , both pitiable and offensive .
&quot; But you are so busy . &quot; &quot; Oh , no , I &apos;m not at all busy , &quot; answered Varenka , but at that moment she had to leave her new friends because two little Russian girls , children of an invalid , ran up to her .
Since he knew nothing of this , and drew his inspiration , not directly from life , but indirectly from life embodied in art , his inspiration came very quickly and easily , and as quickly and easily came his success in painting something very similar to the sort of painting he was trying to imitate .
He rang up his servant , dressed in haste , and went out onto the steps , completely forgetting the dream and only worried at being late .
That means nothing .
Mind now , remember your promise , &quot; said Kitty .
All the long day of toil had left no trace in them but lightness of heart .
Up to the first obstacle , the stream , he could not guide the motions of his mare .
&quot; Very well , we will go to them , &quot; she said .
My wife and I are like white wolves - everyone knows us , &quot; answered Korsunsky .
In whatever position she might be placed , she could not lose her son .
The point in discussion was the question then in vogue : Is there a line to be drawn between psychological and physiological phenomena in man ?
&quot; But I personally value friendly relations with you more because .... &quot; &quot; Why , why ? &quot; Konstantin could not say that he valued it more because Nikolay was unhappy , and needed affection .
&quot; Yes ! &quot; she said significantly , deliberately .
&quot; Well , maman , are you perfectly well ? &quot; he repeated , turning to his mother .
&quot; Oh , oh , oh ! &quot; he kept repeating in despair , as he remembered the acutely painful sensations caused him by this quarrel .
She knew Anna Arkadyevna , but only very slightly , and she came now to her sister &apos;s with some trepidation , at the prospect of meeting this fashionable Petersburg lady , whom everyone spoke so highly of .
He read the letters .
Your sorrow is a great one , but you ought to find consolation . &quot; &quot; I am crushed , I am annihilated , I am no longer a man ! &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch , letting go her hand , but still gazing into her brimming eyes .
Levin was firmly convinced that if the buckwheat had been scorched , it was only because the precautions had not been taken , for which he had hundreds of times given orders .
&quot; Our life must go on as it has done in the past .... &quot; &quot; That life was miserable enough in the old days ; it has been awful of late .
And the princess noticed again that Kitty reddened .
No , no , reconciliation is impossible .
Mediæval Italian life so fascinated Vronsky that he even wore a hat and flung a cloak over his shoulder in the mediæval style , which , indeed , was extremely becoming to him .
At nine o &apos;clock they heard the bell and the faint vibration of a carriage over the mud .
&quot; No , wait a minute ; why not ? &quot; &quot; Oh , nothing ; your father has come , and besides , they will feel awkward at your helping . &quot; &quot; No , tell me why you don &apos;t want me to be often at the Petrovs . &quot;
Darya Alexandrovna in her intimate , philosophical talks with her sister , her mother , and her friends very often astonished them by the freedom of her views in regard to religion .
She glanced at him .
With a sense of weariness and uncleanness from the night spent in the train , in the early fog of Petersburg Alexey Alexandrovitch drove through the deserted Nevsky and stared straight before him , not thinking of what was awaiting him .
And I should be so glad ...
Seryozha had been shy of his father before , and now , ever since Alexey Alexandrovitch had taken to calling him young man , and since that insoluble question had occurred to him whether Vronsky were a friend or a foe , he avoided his father .
And with her love I cannot feel envious of Serpuhovskoy . &quot; And slowly twirling his mustaches , he got up from the table and walked about the room .
On his way back he caught unobserved another moth .
The long white ridge of his spine , with the huge , prominent shoulder blades and jutting ribs and vertebrae , was bare , and Marya Nikolaevna and the waiter were struggling with the sleeve of the night shirt , and could not get the long , limp arm into it .
Vronsky did not even look at it , but anxious to get in a long way first began sawing away at the reins , lifting the mare &apos;s head and letting it go in time with her paces .
And this is incomprehensible , and that &apos;s why it annoys them .
And , loving her as he did , though he did not understand the reason of them , and jeered at these domestic pursuits , he could not help admiring them .
&quot; That &apos;s my illness .
In her family &apos;s eyes he had no ordinary , definite career and position in society , while his contemporaries by this time , when he was thirty @-@ two , were already , one a colonel , and another a professor , another director of a bank and railways , or president of a board like Oblonsky .
The work went rapidly .
They keep chopping and changing their bits of land .
At that meeting Vronsky perceived that Golenishtchev had taken up a sort of lofty , intellectually liberal line , and was consequently disposed to look down upon Vronsky &apos;s interests and calling in life .
&quot; You can &apos;t forgive me , &quot; he whispered .
On the land I scarcely walk or drive about at all to look after things .
Anna , forgetting her inward agitation in the work of packing , was standing at a table in her boudoir , packing her traveling bag , when Annushka called her attention to the rattle of some carriage driving up .
Chapter 20 The next day the sick man received the sacrament and extreme unction .
This feeling was so strong that he could not help smiling .
The strong , exquisite , perfectly correct lines of the stallion , with his superb hind @-@ quarters and excessively short pasterns almost over his hoofs , attracted Vronsky &apos;s attention in spite of himself .
It was not merely the sisters , the women @-@ friends and female relations of the bride who were following every detail of the ceremony .
&quot; One time you don &apos;t like my being dull , and another time you don &apos;t like my being lively .
You consider Vronsky an aristocrat , but I don &apos;t .
&quot; It is the accepted view now that real culture must be purely classical ; but we see most intense disputes on each side of the question , and there is no denying that the opposite camp has strong points in its favor . &quot; &quot; You are for classics , Sergey Ivanovitch .
&quot; In pain ! &quot; &quot; In pain , where ? &quot; &quot; Everywhere . &quot; &quot; It will be over today , you will see , &quot; said Marya Nikolaevna .
The mare had broken her back , and it was decided to shoot her .
&quot; The one comfort is like that prayer , which I always liked : &quot; Forgive me not according to my unworthiness , but according to Thy loving @-@ kindness . &quot; That &apos;s the only way she can forgive me . &quot; Chapter 11 Levin emptied his glass , and they were silent for a while .
For both Levin and the young peasant behind him , such changes of position were difficult .
&quot; N @-@ n @-@ no ! &quot; said Levin .
&quot; You remember the children , Stiva , to play with them ; but I remember them , and know that this means their ruin , &quot; she said - obviously one of the phrases she had more than once repeated to herself in the course of the last few days .
Oblonsky and Vronsky had both seen the mutilated corpse .
The sense of death , which had been evoked in all by his taking leave of life on the night when he had sent for his brother , was broken up .
&quot; But of course .... One thing : you must not act in haste .
What ?
&quot; Eh ? &quot; said Levin cheerily , already feeling the effect of his method .
I &apos;ll come directly .
&quot; No , please , let us stay here . &quot; She took off her kerchief and her hat , and catching it in a lock of her black hair , which was a mass of curls , she tossed her head and shook her hair down .
Fresh oysters have come in . &quot; &quot; Ah !
&quot; My head &apos;s begun to ache ; I &apos;m going home , &quot; he said to Serpuhovskoy .
The union Anna had cemented turned out to be of no solid character , and family harmony was breaking down again at the same point .
He felt for the first moment as a man feels when , having suddenly received a violent blow from behind , he turns round , angry and eager to avenge himself , to look for his antagonist , and finds that it is he himself who has accidentally struck himself , that there is no one to be angry with , and that he must put up with and try to soothe the pain .
And pity for her , and remorse for having desired her death , and most of all , the joy of forgiveness , made him at once conscious , not simply of the relief of his own sufferings , but of a spiritual peace he had never experienced before .
They turned to go back , when suddenly they heard , not noisy talk , but shouting .
But he knew that she had strength left more than enough for the remaining five hundred yards .
I know it &apos;s disgraceful , but I go to sleep at the opera , and I sit out the _ opera bouffe _ to the last minute , and enjoy it .
When she came into the bedroom , he was already in bed .
And so I simply inform you that our relations must be just as they have always been , and that only in the event of your compromising me I shall be obliged to take steps to secure my honor . &quot; &quot; But our relations cannot be the same as always , &quot; Anna began in a timid voice , looking at him with dismay .
The big , old house at Ergushovo had been pulled down long ago , and the old prince had had the lodge done up and built on to .
&quot; What were you talking about ? &quot; he said , knitting his brows , and turning his scared eyes from one to the other .
And the ploughing of the further land to go on without a break so as to let it ripen lying fallow .
Ah !
I shall soon be confined ; leave him ! &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch flew into a rage , and , snatching his hand from her , he went out of the room without a word .
&quot; I devote myself to it , and I have means , but I can do nothing .
She noticed his strange face , agitated and gloomy , and a panic came over her .
&quot; But I ... you are forgetting me ... does it make it easier for me ? &quot; &quot; Wait a minute .
The heavy smell was replaced by the smell of aromatic vinegar , which Kitty with pouting lips and puffed @-@ out , rosy cheeks was squirting through a little pipe .
&quot; I must write to Alexey though , &quot; and Betsy sat down to the table , scribbled a few lines , and put the note in an envelope .
And I can &apos;t see why they liked that remark so . &quot; The conversation was cut short by this observation , and a new subject had to be thought of again .
And if both are agreed about it , the details and formalities become a matter of no importance .
Alexey Alexandrovitch could not hear or see a child or woman crying without being moved .
What if she &apos;s marrying me simply to be married ?
How has she ... ? &quot; While they were saying this , Laska , with ears pricked up , was looking upwards at the sky , and reproachfully at them .
Yes , even Dram , such an honest , capable fellow ... Semyonov , Tchagin , Sigonin , &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch remembered .
The dew was falling by now ; the mowers were in the sun only on the hillside , but below , where a mist was rising , and on the opposite side , they mowed into the fresh , dewy shade .
The fact that this reflection was but one of millions of reflections , which as Mihailov knew for certain would be true , did not diminish for him the significance of Golenishtchev &apos;s remark .
I ought to tell you .... &quot; This was one of the things he had meant to speak about .
&quot; You are ill and overwrought , &quot; he said ; &quot; believe me , you &apos;re exaggerating dreadfully .
If I doubted .... &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s that coming ? &quot; said Vronsky suddenly , pointing to two ladies walking towards them .
Now he experienced a feeling akin to that of a man who , while calmly crossing a precipice by a bridge , should suddenly discover that the bridge is broken , and that there is a chasm below .
During the reading , especially at the frequent and rapid repetition of the same words , &quot; Lord , have mercy on us ! &quot; which resounded with an echo , Levin felt that thought was shut and sealed up , and that it must not be touched or stirred now or confusion would be the result ; and so standing behind the deacon he went on thinking of his own affairs , neither listening nor examining what was said .
It &apos;s true it &apos;s bad _ her _ having been a governess in our house .
&quot; You understand .
&quot; Seryozha ?
Bad as this might be , it was anyway better than a rupture , which would put her in a hopeless and shameful position , and deprive him of everything he cared for .
Stiva told me , and I congratulate you .
She exerted herself to the utmost , felt the hopelessness of the position , and was every instant suppressing the tears that started into her eyes .
&quot; Oh , all right , I &apos;ll have it later . &quot; &quot; Very well , very well .
and why not ? &quot; responded Yegor .
The elder had just dropped in the hook , and was carefully pulling the float from behind a bush , entirely absorbed in what he was doing .
In short , a bloodless revolution , but a revolution of the greatest magnitude , beginning in the little circle of our district , then the province , then Russia , the whole world .
The children especially going to school , the bluish doves flying down from the roofs to the pavement , and the little loaves covered with flour , thrust out by an unseen hand , touched him .
&quot; _ Au revoir ! _ &quot; She gave him her hand , and with her rapid , springy step she passed by the porter and vanished into the carriage .
She was lying turned with her face towards him .
He advised eggs , raw or hardly cooked , and seltzer water , with warm milk at a certain temperature .
But as soon as she no longer saw him , she was aware of the spot on her hand that his lips had touched , and she shuddered with repulsion .
The dress was set right , but there was nearly a quarrel with the English governess .
&quot; I had no time ; I am very busy , &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch responded dryly .
I don &apos;t like going into that house .
&quot; On Mondays we &apos;re at home .
I shall go to him . &quot; Kitty &apos;s face changed at once .
And glancing casually at the gentleman , who still stood there gazing intently at him , he would have gone on .
Ah , Anna , if you had seen it !
( Kuzovlev had let go the reins as he took the leap , and the mare had sent him flying over her head . )
&quot; Princess , will you allow it ? &quot; And Vronsky stood up , looking for a little table .
&quot; She has been continually asking after you .
She could not bring herself to look those of her own household in the face .
In the drawing @-@ room there were already sitting Prince Alexander Dmitrievitch Shtcherbatsky , young Shtcherbatsky , Turovtsin , Kitty , and Karenin .
You &apos;re not tired ? &quot; said Korsunsky , a little out of breath .
They gathered a whole basketful of mushrooms ; even Lily found a birch mushroom .
Chapter 31 It was a wet day ; it had been raining all the morning , and the invalids , with their parasols , had flocked into the arcades .
The samovar was beginning to sing ; the laborers and the family , having disposed of the horses , came in to dinner .
Betsy and Stremov remained at the tea @-@ table .
At that instant Kitty came up from the spring beaming with delight that her mother had become acquainted with her unknown friend .
She walked on a few steps in silence , gathering up her courage ; then suddenly she stopped .
All had passed very simply and easily .
She was charming with the new radiance of happiness in her face .
Well , you must excuse me , ladies and gentlemen , but to my mind it is better fun to play the ring game , &quot; said the old prince , looking at Vronsky , and guessing that it had been his suggestion .
This was all Levin noticed , and without wondering who it could be , he gazed absently at the coach .
He expected some queer outburst from Levin .
But repeating words did not check his imagination for long .
Well , so he &apos;s standing .... No , I say , do listen . &quot; &quot; I am listening , &quot; answered Vronsky , rubbing himself with a rough towel .
They had been comrades at the university , and though they rarely met , they thought highly of each other and were excellent friends , and so there was no one to whom the doctor would have given his opinion of a patient so freely as to Sludin .
&quot; Isn &apos;t it time to go home ? &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch .
But at the same second he felt that he was beating himself .
I don &apos;t see the least chance of it .
what a happy time you are at , &quot; pursued Anna .
They boldly talk of spiritual force , and then try to subject it to material experiment . &quot; Everyone was waiting for him to finish , and he felt it .
So we were saying the problem may be put thus : to maintain nutrition and to give tone to the nerves .
For me there is one thing , and one thing only - your love .
The same experience befell him as Golenishtchev , who felt that he had nothing to say , and continually deceived himself with the theory that his idea was not yet mature , that he was working it out and collecting materials .
I warned Kitty . &quot; &quot; It will make no difference , &quot; said Madame Lvova ; &quot; we &apos;re all obedient wives ; it &apos;s in our family . &quot; &quot; Oh , I stepped on the rug before Vassily on purpose .
The doctor was meantime with difficulty restraining the expression of his contempt for this old gentleman , and with difficulty condescending to the level of his intelligence .
Sergey Ivanovitch wound up the last line , untied the horse , and they drove off .
In old times , you see , a man who wanted to educate himself - a Frenchman , for instance - would have set to work to study all the classics and theologians and tragedians and historiaris and philosophers , and , you know , all the intellectual work that came in his way .
He had expected to find the physical signs of the approach of death more marked - greater weakness , greater emaciation , but still almost the same condition of things .
He felt that the love that bound him to Anna was not a momentary impulse , which would pass , as worldly intrigues do pass , leaving no other traces in the life of either but pleasant or unpleasant memories .
Where did you go after the Shtcherbatskys &quot; ? &quot; &quot; Home , &quot; answered Vronsky .
Getting his right foot in the stirrup , he smoothed the double reins , as he always did , between his fingers , and Cord let go .
On coming back with Kitty from the springs , the prince , who had asked the colonel , and Marya Yevgenyevna , and Varenka all to come and have coffee with them , gave orders for a table and chairs to be taken into the garden under the chestnut tree , and lunch to be laid there .
&quot; Oh , mercy !
She felt her eyes opening wider and wider , her fingers and toes twitching nervously , something within oppressing her breathing , while all shapes and sounds seemed in the uncertain half @-@ light to strike her with unaccustomed vividness .
Most likely you &apos;ve not made a study of spiders and don &apos;t know their character ; and so it is with me . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s very well for you to talk like that ; it &apos;s very much like that gentleman in Dickens who used to fling all difficult questions over his right shoulder .
A boy in Russian dress , desperately waving his arms and bowed down to the ground , overtook her .
Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that she was weeping , and could not control her tears , nor even the sobs that were shaking her bosom .
She could not understand how lofty and beyond her it all was , and she ought not to have dared to allude to it .
&quot; Yes , _ ma chère _ .
&quot; If I could only be even a little like you ! &quot; &quot; Why should you be like anyone ?
&quot; Here &apos;s Lavrenty , &quot; said Vronsky , looking out of the window ; &quot; now we can go , if you like . &quot; The old butler , who had traveled with the countess , came to the carriage to announce that everything was ready , and the countess got up to go .
He had not even plans and aims for the future , he left its arrangement to others , knowing that everything would be delightful .
You haven &apos;t read them : they &apos;ve thrashed that question out thoroughly . &quot; He saw now distinctly that Kauffmann and Michelli had nothing to tell him .
I &apos;m going to the princess &apos;s . &quot; &quot; Which dress am I to get ready ? &quot; Chapter 17 The croquet party to which the Princess Tverskaya had invited Anna was to consist of two ladies and their adorers .
&quot; Not at all .
It &apos;s just as if a child of yours were dead , and they were to say to you : He would have been like this and like that , and he might have lived , and how happy you would have been in him .
Alexey Alexandrovitch did not want to see anyone in Moscow , and least of all his wife &apos;s brother .
How have you spent the day ? &quot; &quot; Very well .
&quot; Excuse me , but you know one really can &apos;t argue in that way , &quot; he observed .
Well , what am I to do ? &quot; ( _ He _ was her husband . )
In England he had galloped in a red coat over hedges and killed two hundred pheasants for a bet .
You know it &apos;s not &quot; timber , &quot; &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , hoping by this distinction to convince Levin completely of the unfairness of his doubts .
Oh , that I should live to see it !
And do you suppose it weighs on him any less than on you ?
She went to the furthest end of the little drawing @-@ room and sank into a low chair .
Your and our general dissatisfaction with the system shows that either we are to blame or the laborers .
I &apos;m not going to offer you my protection ... though , indeed , why shouldn &apos;t I protect you ? - you &apos;ve protected me often enough !
A crowd of friends and outsiders pressed round him .
&quot; Very well , &quot; she said all at once .
&quot; How is it Betsy doesn &apos;t come ? ... &quot; &quot; Yes , &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch , and getting up , he folded his hands and cracked his fingers .
Seventeen officers , looking serious and severe , many with pale faces , met together in the pavilion and drew the numbers .
&quot; And after that he will tell me .... What !
When he thought of her , he could call up a vivid picture of her to himself , especially the charm of that little fair head , so freely set on the shapely girlish shoulders , and so full of childish brightness and good humor .
&quot; Oh , nothing , &quot; responded Oblonsky .
&quot; You must understand , &quot; said he , &quot; it &apos;s not love .
Everyone seemed , somehow , hugely delighted , as though they had just been at a wedding .
But there was no help for it , so it must be , so it would have to be .
He tossed his head upwards and waved the glass in his hand , greeting Vronsky , and showing him by the gesture that he could not come to him before the quartermaster , who stood craning forward his lips ready to be kissed .
Tell me . &quot; &quot; I have told you . &quot; &quot; When was it ? &quot; &quot; When I was at their house the last time . &quot; &quot; Do you know that , &quot; said Darya Alexandrovna , &quot; I am awfully , awfully sorry for her .
&quot; Of course , &quot; he repeated , when for the third time his thought passed again round the same spellbound circle of memories and images , and pulling the revolver to the left side of his chest , and clutching it vigorously with his whole hand , as it were , squeezing it in his fist , he pulled the trigger .
All such questions as , for instance , of the cause of failure of crops , of the adherence of certain tribes to their ancient beliefs , etc . - questions which , but for the convenient intervention of the official machine , are not , and cannot be solved for ages - received full , unhesitating solution .
She felt she was afraid of him , and afraid of the coming interview .
&quot; I assure you that I sleep everywhere , and always like a marmot . &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the question ? &quot; inquired Stepan Arkadyevitch , coming out of his room and addressing his wife .
But he was continually met and stopped by acquaintances , who told him about the previous races , and kept asking him why he was so late .
Levin tried again to move away on tiptoe , but the sick man stirred again and said : &quot; Don &apos;t go . &quot; The dawn came ; the sick man &apos;s condition was unchanged .
He despised the nobility , and believed the mass of the nobility to be secretly in favor of serfdom , and only concealing their views from cowardice .
&quot; Shall I tell you ? &quot; &quot; Yes , yes , yes .... &quot; &quot; I &apos;m with child , &quot; she said , softly and deliberately .
&quot; I &apos;ve come to see you in the first place , &quot; he said , embracing and kissing him , &quot; to have some stand @-@ shooting second , and to sell the forest at Ergushovo third . &quot; &quot; Delightful !
I asked , &quot; Why , how does the wise woman cure screaming fits ? &quot; &quot; She puts the child on the hen @-@ roost and repeats some charm .... &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;re saying it yourself !
A drinking party now , or the _ Château des Fleurs _ , would be more in my line ! &quot; The old prince sat in silence , his bright little eyes watching Karenin from one side , and Stepan Arkadyevitch saw that he had already formed a phrase to sum up that politician of whom guests were invited to partake as though he were a sturgeon .
&quot; Oh , why so ? ...
Moreover , this new head had the further reputation of being a bear in his manners , and was , according to all reports , a man of a class in all respects the opposite of that to which his predecessor had belonged , and to which Stepan Arkadyevitch had hitherto belonged himself .
&quot; She &apos;s young , you see , she &apos;s pretty , &quot; she went on .
On meeting Anna Karenina , as he was Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s enemy in the government , he tried , like a shrewd man and a man of the world , to be particularly cordial with her , the wife of his enemy .
She saw that of late years much was changed in the manners of society , that a mother &apos;s duties had become still more difficult .
&quot; How do you do , Kamerovsky ? &quot; he added , coldly shaking hands with Kamerovsky .
She who had so feared he would take her condition too lightly was now vexed with him for deducing from it the necessity of taking some step .
&quot; After yours I don &apos;t want another portrait .
Your brother &apos;s coming , and Karenin , my brother @-@ in @-@ law . &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t mean to say he &apos;s here ? &quot; said Levin , and he wanted to inquire about Kitty .
No !
I &apos;m dying now , I know I shall die , ask him .
Near the entrance was a dresser full of crockery .
she seemed to make an effort to control herself , to try not to show these signs of delight , but they came out on her face of themselves .
You &apos;re the same age as my Seryozha , &quot; she added , addressing the little girl as she ran in .
Then Levin had driven over himself , and arranged to have the grass cut , partly by hired labor , partly at a payment of a certain proportion of the crop .
You would not believe how charming he was as a youth , but I did not understand him then . &quot; &quot; I can quite , quite believe it .
Matvey was already holding up the shirt like a horse &apos;s collar , and , blowing off some invisible speck , he slipped it with obvious pleasure over the well @-@ groomed body of his master .
But in spite of failing health , in spite of his domestic griefs , he did not give in .
&quot; He isn &apos;t in his old argumentative mood .
We ourselves sent for the district doctor for Agafea Mihalovna . &quot; &quot; Oh , well , but I fancy her wrist will never be straight again . &quot; &quot; That remains to be proved .... Next , the peasant who can read and write is as a workman of more use and value to you . &quot; &quot; No , you can ask anyone you like , &quot; Konstantin Levin answered with decision , &quot; the man that can read and write is much inferior as a workman .
Show me them all . &quot; She mentioned them , not only remembering the names , but the years , months , characters , illnesses of all the children , and Dolly could not but appreciate that .
Chapter 3 &quot; Do you know , I &apos;ve been thinking about you , &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch .
&quot; If no one follows us about like a shadow , that &apos;s no proof that we &apos;ve any right to blame her . &quot; And having duly disposed of Anna &apos;s friend , the Princess Myakaya got up , and together with the ambassador &apos;s wife , joined the group at the table , where the conversation was dealing with the king of Prussia .
Chapter 6 When the ceremony of plighting troth was over , the beadle spread before the lectern in the middle of the church a piece of pink silken stuff , the choir sang a complicated and elaborate psalm , in which the bass and tenor sang responses to one another , and the priest turning round pointed the bridal pair to the pink silk rug .
I know that he &apos;s clever , learned , religious somewhat ....
Everything was capital , everything was cheering .
&quot; What do you doubt about principally ? &quot; &quot; I doubt of everything .
More carriages were continually driving up , and ladies wearing flowers and carrying their trains , and men taking off their helmets or black hats kept walking into the church .
Princess Shtcherbatskaya wished , above everything , to present her daughter to this German princess , and the day after their arrival she duly performed this rite .
As he sipped his coffee , he opened a still damp morning paper , and began reading it .
&quot; Well , good @-@ bye , my darling , &quot; said Betsy , getting up .
&quot; I have decided , but I was afraid you might not agree . &quot; Levin saw it was a joke , but he could not smile .
Having got rid of the staff captain &apos;s widow , Stepan Arkadyevitch took his hat and stopped to recollect whether he had forgotten anything .
During all this early time they had a peculiarly vivid sense of tension , as it were , a tugging in opposite directions of the chain by which they were bound .
He sat down and wrote a long phrase .
Now in the solitude of the country , she began to be more and more frequently aware of those joys .
Now I &apos;m my real self , all myself .
&quot; I do not enter into the details of why a woman wants to see her lover . &quot; &quot; I meant , I only .... &quot; she said , flushing hotly .
The baby screamed louder than ever , struggling and sobbing .
Where you can go , I can .... &quot; &quot; Well , for one thing then , because this woman &apos;s there whom you can &apos;t meet . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know and don &apos;t care to know who &apos;s there and what .
Vronsky &apos;s talk about his painting he met with stubborn silence , and he was as stubbornly silent when he was shown Vronsky &apos;s picture .
&quot; What a horrible death ! &quot; said a gentleman , passing by .
A little vodka for the lads ? &quot; At the afternoon rest , when they were sitting down again , and those who smoked had lighted their pipes , the old man told the men that &quot; Mashkin Upland &apos;s to be cut - there &apos;ll be some vodka . &quot; &quot; Why not cut it ?
A flash of eagerness suffused the face of Alexey Alexandrovitch as he rapidly wrote out a synopsis of these ideas for his own benefit .
Alexey Alexandrovitch was immediately interested in the subject , and began seriously defending the new imperial decree against Princess Betsy , who had attacked it .
&quot; What are the Shtcherbatskys doing ?
&quot; Impossible ! &quot; he cried , at the news that Laura had flung over Fertinghof and had made up to Mileev .
This was a feeling of loathing for something - whether for Alexey Alexandrovitch , or for himself , or for the whole world , he could not have said .
&quot; And go away , and go away ! &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t look down on it at all , &quot; said Konstantin Levin timidly .
Vronsky took off his soft , wide @-@ brimmed hat and passed his handkerchief over his heated brow and hair , which had grown half over his ears , and was brushed back covering the bald patch on his head .
He knew not that she was instinctively aware of this , and preparing herself for this time of terrible toil , did not reproach herself for the moments of carelessness and happiness in her love that she enjoyed now while gaily building her nest for the future .
After explaining that he could not come at the beginning of the ballet , he promised he would come for the last act and take her to supper .
Making way for the lady who had come in , Vronsky went up to the princess and then to Kitty .
&quot; Arrange everything with Darya in the sitting room for Anna Arkadyevna , &quot; he said to Matvey when he came in .
But directly he began to illustrate his meaning , she understood at once .
But I know that was what you meant to do . &quot; &quot; I cannot paint a Christ that is not in my heart , &quot; said Mihailov gloomily .
Yes , I agree , it &apos;s better in fact .
&quot; But that &apos;s just the aim of civilization - to make everything a source of enjoyment . &quot; &quot; Well , if that &apos;s its aim , I &apos;d rather be a savage . &quot; &quot; And so you are a savage .
There were no pots and pans ; there was no copper in the washhouse , nor even an ironing @-@ board in the maids &quot; room .
With the prince still ? &quot; She knew every detail of his existence .
The doctor opined that the indisposition arose from fatigue and excitement , and prescribed rest .
Meanwhile the officiating clergy had got into their vestments , and the priest and deacon came out to the lectern , which stood in the forepart of the church .
&quot; Yes , I suppose so , &quot; answered Anna , as it were wondering at the boldness of his question ; but the irrepressible , quivering brilliance of her eyes and her smile set him on fire as she said it .
&quot; No ; so I can say it ....
&quot; There is another law at work there . &quot; &quot; I fancy that the greater influence is always on the side of true civilization , &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch , slightly lifting his eyebrows .
&quot; Don &apos;t you know that you &apos;re all my life to me ?
&quot; Alone , or with her husband ? &quot; inquired Matvey .
To get out of these difficulties , he could not apply to his mother for money .
Again they had not done as he had ordered .
But it lasted only an instant .
&quot; I see no possible way out of it . &quot; &quot; There is some way of getting out of every position , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , standing up and becoming more cheerful .
Anything &apos;s better than endless misery , disgrace , unfaithfulness ! &quot; With despair in his heart and bitter anger against all men , against himself , against her , he went out of the hotel and drove to her house .
&quot; Oh !
&quot; I know how men like Stiva look at it .
&quot; Stiva !
They crowded round Levin with happy faces , quarreling among themselves , and offering their services .
&quot; That &apos;s so .
&quot; Yes , he is happy and content ! &quot; she thought ; &quot; while I .... And that disgusting good nature , which everyone likes him for and praises - I hate that good nature of his , &quot; she thought .
&quot; Don &apos;t tell me , &quot; she added hastily , &quot; only say if I &apos;m right . &quot; &quot; No , why not ?
&quot; No ; how so ? &quot; she replied .
&quot; I made a mistake in linking my life to hers ; but there was nothing wrong in my mistake , and so I cannot be unhappy .
Directly Sergey Ivanovitch had concluded the conversation with his jest , Pestsov promptly started a new one .
There , that &apos;s enough , enough said about it , &quot; he said , getting up from his seat .
why not ? &quot; said Kitty , opening her eyes wide , and clutching at Varenka &apos;s parasol , so as not to let her go .
&quot; But never mind , don &apos;t let &apos;s talk of him .
She raves about you .
&quot; What !
It can &apos;t be helped .
He had heard at the beginning of the winter that she was at Petersburg with her sister , the wife of the diplomat , and he did not know whether she had come back or not ; but he changed his mind and did not ask .
I feel that it &apos;s my duty to be with my husband when he &apos;s in trouble , but you try on purpose to hurt me , you try on purpose not to understand .... &quot; &quot; No ; this is awful !
And don &apos;t imagine , &quot; he added , detecting a look of dissatisfaction on Oblonsky &apos;s face , &quot; that I shan &apos;t appreciate your choice .
With a slight bow to Levin he began immediately reading prayers in the official voice .
If a man &apos;s no use , he can go , and we can manage by ourselves . &quot; &quot; Father , Finogen wants some tar , &quot; said the young woman in the clogs , coming in .
&quot; Why mine ? &quot; said Anna .
&quot; Well , well , allow me to kiss your hand . &quot; &quot; Good @-@ bye , Ivan Petrovitch .
On hearing it , he felt come upon him with tenfold intensity that strange feeling of loathing of someone .
Only I don &apos;t know what he will decide about Seryozha . &quot; He could not conceive how at this moment of their meeting she could remember and think of her son , of divorce .
She had been waiting for him .
Chapter 2 On the day of the wedding , according to the Russian custom ( the princess and Darya Alexandrovna insisted on strictly keeping all the customs ) , Levin did not see his betrothed , and dined at his hotel with three bachelor friends , casually brought together at his rooms .
Levin stealthily withdrew his hand , and without looking at the dying man , went off to his own room and went to sleep .
At the same time as the traveler there was announced a provincial marshal of nobility on a visit to Petersburg , with whom Alexey Alexandrovitch had to have some conversation .
He looked at her and hastily turned away , scrutinizing other faces .
These were happy moments .
The priest had not quite finished reading the prayer when the dying man stretched , sighed , and opened his eyes .
He touched the tassel of the cushion , and tried to think of Varya , of when he had seen her last .
After dinner , Darya Alexandrovna , sitting alone with him on the balcony , began to speak of Kitty .
He felt that in not answering Darya Alexandrovna &apos;s letter he had by his rudeness , of which he could not think without a flush of shame , burned his ships , and that he would never go and see them again .
After admiring the young ones of that year , who were particularly fine - the early calves were the size of a peasant &apos;s cow , and Pava &apos;s daughter , at three months old , was as big as a yearling - Levin gave orders for a trough to be brought out and for them to be fed in the paddock .
Moreover , it was apparent also that the harrows and all the agricultural implements , which he had directed to be looked over and repaired in the winter , for which very purpose he had hired three carpenters , had not been put into repair , and the harrows were being repaired when they ought to have been harrowing the field .
I don &apos;t understand .... &quot; &quot; So did Kitty perhaps refuse him ? ...
In the arcade they met Varenka herself .
If one wants the result , one must admit the means . &quot; &quot; If it is so .... &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch began , suddenly turning white ; but at that moment the lawyer rose and again went to the door to speak to the intruding clerk .
That was evident from the way they spoke to him , from the friendly , affectionate way even those he did not know looked at him .
&quot; But all the same I admire your grandeur , and am proud that I &apos;ve a friend in such a great person .
&quot; It &apos;s from that woman , I think , your brother &apos;s .... &quot; she said .
However , now that the glove had been thrown down to him , he had boldly picked it up and demanded the appointment of a special commission to investigate and verify the working of the Board of Irrigation of the lands in the Zaraisky province .
&quot; No sort of necessity , &quot; she thought , &quot; for a man to come and say good @-@ bye to the woman he loves , for whom he was ready to ruin himself , and has ruined himself , and who cannot live without him .
Vronsky , seeing his cousin from his stall in the front row , did not wait till the _ entr &apos;acte _ , but went to her box .
How to do this ? - that &apos;s a matter of detail ; but undoubtedly it can be done . &quot; This idea threw Levin into a great excitement .
Where was her husband ?
What about the amalgamation of classes ? &quot; said Oblonsky .
Once in a previous year he had gone to look at the mowing , and being made very angry by the bailiff he had recourse to his favorite means for regaining his temper , - he took a scythe from a peasant and began mowing .
It &apos;s time I was dead . &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s a good one ! &quot; said Shtcherbatsky , laughing ; &quot; why , I &apos;m only just getting ready to begin . &quot; &quot; Yes , I thought the same not long ago , but now I know I shall soon be dead . &quot; Levin said what he had genuinely been thinking of late .
It began to get dark .
&quot; Your brother is here , &quot; he said , standing up .
Considering and rejecting the duel , Alexey Alexandrovitch turned to divorce - another solution selected by several of the husbands he remembered .
If you would kindly sign the title @-@ deed .... &quot; Within an hour the merchant , stroking his big overcoat neatly down , and hooking up his jacket , with the agreement in his pocket , seated himself in his tightly covered trap , and drove homewards .
The colonel had called in Vronsky just because he knew him to be an honorable and intelligent man , and , more than all , a man who cared for the honor of the regiment .
That year races and a steeplechase had been arranged for the officers .
The whole day I have had to be making arrangements , arrangements about household matters arising &quot; ( he emphasized the word _ arising _ ) &quot; from my new , solitary position .
&quot; Freedom !
He considered a revolution in economic conditions nonsense .
On the right side of the warm church , in the crowd of frock coats and white ties , uniforms and broadcloth , velvet , satin , hair and flowers , bare shoulders and arms and long gloves , there was discreet but lively conversation that echoed strangely in the high cupola .
I know everyone will forget him .
&quot; Divorce by our laws , &quot; he said , with a slight shade of disapprobation of our laws , &quot; is possible , as you are aware , in the following cases ....
In that brief look Vronsky had time to notice the suppressed eagerness which played over her face , and flitted between the brilliant eyes and the faint smile that curved her red lips .
She was deeply moved .
&quot; Don &apos;t speak of that , don &apos;t think of it , &quot; he said , turning her hand in his , and trying to draw her attention to him ; but still she did not look at him .
No , it was better anyway , &quot; she added , touched by his despairing face .
The eagerness died out of her face , as it always did , at the sight of her husband ; she dropped her head and looked round uneasily at Betsy .
He gave orders for the carriage that was awaiting him to be taken back , and for no one to be admitted , and he did not go down to dinner .
You &apos;re fool enough at all times , and when you start explaining things in Italian you &apos;re a fool three times as foolish , &quot; he said after a long dispute .
She loved him for himself , and for his love for her .
A prince , isn &apos;t he ? &quot; &quot; Is that her sister in the white satin ?
Sergey Ivanovitch had long ago finished dinner , and was drinking iced lemon and water in his own room , looking through the reviews and papers which he had only just received by post , when Levin rushed into the room , talking merrily , with his wet and matted hair sticking to his forehead , and his back and chest grimed and moist .
I &apos;ve been skating , and I &apos;m hungry .
&quot; Yes , how can you go alone at night like this ? &quot; chimed in the princess .
Oblonsky took off his overcoat , and with his hat over one ear walked into the dining @-@ room , giving directions to the Tatar waiters , who were clustered about him in evening coats , bearing napkins .
&quot; Something else in the same line , &quot; he said to himself bitterly , opening the second telegram .
The lump in his throat rose higher and higher , tears that would not be checked came into his eyes .
Kitty was glad of all this , but she could not be light @-@ hearted .
She watched his progress towards the pavilion , saw him now responding condescendingly to an ingratiating bow , now exchanging friendly , nonchalant greetings with his equals , now assiduously trying to catch the eye of some great one of this world , and taking off his big round hat that squeezed the tips of his ears .
&quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch , believe me , she appreciates your generosity , &quot; he said .
Levin kissed her smiling lips with timid care , gave her his arm , and with a new strange sense of closeness , walked out of the church .
How I loved him !
&quot; Oh , that &apos;s all very well .
She remembered the simple delight expressed on the round , good @-@ humored face of Anna Pavlovna at their meetings ; she remembered their secret confabulations about the invalid , their plots to draw him away from the work which was forbidden him , and to get him out @-@ of @-@ doors ; the devotion of the youngest boy , who used to call her &quot; my Kitty , &quot; and would not go to bed without her .
One thing was unmistakable , that there must be no delay , as it was already half @-@ past six .
&quot; You wouldn &apos;t believe how I &apos;ve missed .... &quot; And with a long pressure of her hand and a meaning smile , he put her in her carriage .
My aim is simply to safeguard my reputation , which is essential for the uninterrupted pursuit of my public duties . &quot; Official duties , which had always been of great consequence in Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s eyes , seemed of special importance to his mind at this moment .
The time has passed so quickly .
&quot; Our Lord and God , Jesus Christ , in the abundance and riches of His lovingkindness , forgives this child .... &quot; and , finishing the prayer of absolution , the priest blessed him and dismissed him .
There were no other eyes like those in the world .
Why does everybody feel called upon to concern himself about me ?
The hiss of the boiler could be heard on the distant rails , and the rumble of something heavy .
&quot; Why has she been crying ?
He stood before her , pale , his lower jaw quivering , and besought her to be calm , not knowing how or why .
Leave Pokrovskoe ?
Or would you like another ? &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s all the same to me , &quot; said Levin , unable to suppress a smile .
&quot; I cannot be made unhappy by the fact that a contemptible woman has committed a crime .
He closed the pane , washed , dressed , and went out into the street .
He was asking for you .
He was reading a book , and thinking of what he was reading , and stopping to listen to Agafea Mihalovna , who gossiped away without flagging , and yet with all that , all sorts of pictures of family life and work in the future rose disconnectedly before his imagination .
&quot; Oh , they feel it directly ? &quot; said Dolly .
But how have you come , where from ? &quot; &quot; Never mind , &quot; she said , laying her hand on his , &quot; come along , I must talk to you . &quot; He saw that something had happened , and that the interview would not be a joyous one .
Do you understand ?
&quot; They &apos;re off !
This feeling Alexey Alexandrovitch was experiencing .
But as soon as he was settled in this position a moth flew over the table .
&quot; You came into the room dancing , &quot; she added .
In the first class he put the debts which he would have to pay at once , or for which he must in any case have the money ready so that on demand for payment there could not be a moment &apos;s delay in paying .
For those few seconds he was sure in anticipation that a higher , juster criticism would be uttered by them , by those very visitors whom he had been so despising a moment before .
The bailiff had always been against the drying machine , and now it was with suppressed triumph that he announced that the buckwheat had been scorched .
Alexey Alexandrovitch sternly cut her short , roundly declaring his wife to be above suspicion , and from that time began to avoid Countess Lidia Ivanovna .
Both the young men were in Vronsky &apos;s company .
But Darya Alexandrovna saw , or fancied she saw , the sensation produced by her children and her .
I don &apos;t like it , &quot; he said , letting his scared eyes rest on his brother &apos;s eyes .
The agony had been strange and terrible , but now it was over ; he felt that he could live again and think of something other than his wife .
&quot; Another turn , eh ?
I feel that I have a heart , and that there is a great deal of good in me .
&quot; Ah !
He heard about it , and knows your lady , and remembers her abroad . &quot; Levin realized that she meant his wife , and did not know what answer to make .
Then the long delay began to be positively discomforting , and relations and guests tried to look as if they were not thinking of the bridegroom but were engrossed in conversation .
Yes , I can , &quot; said Anna , thinking a moment ; and grasping the position in her thought and weighing it in her inner balance , she added : &quot; Yes , I can , I can , I can .
Suppose you &apos;re married , you love your wife , but you &apos;re fascinated by another woman .... &quot; &quot; Excuse me , but I &apos;m absolutely unable to comprehend how ... just as I can &apos;t comprehend how I could now , after my dinner , go straight to a baker &apos;s shop and steal a roll . &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch &apos;s eyes sparkled more than usual .
&quot; And I am certain it will all be forgotten , and Kitty will leave off hating me . &quot; &quot; All the same , Anna , to tell you the truth , I &apos;m not very anxious for this marriage for Kitty .
&quot; But my idea has nothing in common .... &quot; &quot; That , anyway , &quot; said Nikolay Levin , with an ironical smile , his eyes flashing malignantly , &quot; has the charm of - what &apos;s one to call it ? - geometrical symmetry , of clearness , of definiteness .
What is wanted is means of improving nutrition , and not for lowering it . &quot; And the celebrated doctor expounded his plan of treatment with Soden waters , a remedy obviously prescribed primarily on the ground that they could do no harm .
&quot; You don &apos;t wish that ? &quot; he said .
The fact that he did not during the quadrille ask her for the mazurka did not trouble her .
&quot; I &apos;ll tell you what : let &apos;s go to Gurin &apos;s to lunch , and there we can talk .
&quot; Look how natural and sweet it all is . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so funny to see your _ engouements _ , &quot; said the princess .
There are no communists .
Before he had driven many paces away , the dark clouds that had been threatening rain all day broke , and there was a heavy downpour of rain .
But if Karenin had not got his brother @-@ in @-@ law this berth , then through a hundred other personages - brothers , sisters , cousins , uncles , and aunts - Stiva Oblonsky would have received this post , or some other similar one , together with the salary of six thousand absolutely needful for him , as his affairs , in spite of his wife &apos;s considerable property , were in an embarrassed condition .
&quot; So you will send me that book , dear count ?
In Sergey Ivanovitch &apos;s eyes his younger brother was a capital fellow , _ with his heart in the right place _ ( as he expressed it in French ) , but with a mind which , though fairly quick , was too much influenced by the impressions of the moment , and consequently filled with contradictions .
There was terror in her face .
And as I &apos;ve told you before , I tell you again : it &apos;s not right for you not to go to the meetings , and altogether to keep out of the district business .
That &apos;s always been and always will be .
And suddenly he recalled how they used to go to bed together as children , and how they only waited till Fyodor Bogdanitch was out of the room to fling pillows at each other and laugh , laugh irrepressibly , so that even their awe of Fyodor Bogdanitch could not check the effervescing , overbrimming sense of life and happiness .
Levin heard the secretary hesitatingly read the minutes which he obviously did not himself understand ; but Levin saw from this secretary &apos;s face what a good , nice , kind @-@ hearted person he was .
My brother &apos;s staying with me .
The Sviazhskys &quot; home @-@ life was exceedingly pleasant , and Sviazhsky himself , the best type of man taking part in local affairs that Levin knew , was very interesting to him .
But now seeing her in black , she felt that she had not fully seen her charm .
What will it be now ?
Is she being married against her will ? &quot; &quot; Against her will to a fine fellow like that ?
After her husband had left her , she told herself that she was glad , that now everything was made clear , and at least there would be no more lying and deception .
I know that he applies all the power of his intellect to justify existing evils . &quot; &quot; No ; and what do you talk of Sergey Ivanovitch for ? &quot; said Levin , smiling .
That was a delightful hunt ! &quot; said Tchirikov .
He had plenty of so @-@ called connections , but no friendships .
&quot; If that &apos;s one of the villains , don &apos;t let him in ! &quot; Vronsky told the servant not to announce him , and slipped quietly into the first room .
You know I want very much to talk to you , &quot; said Levin .
After accompanying Betsy to the outside hall , once more kissing her hand above the glove , at the point where the pulse beats , and murmuring to her such unseemly nonsense that she did not know whether to laugh or be angry , Stepan Arkadyevitch went to his sister .
But the circle of political , masculine interests had never interested her , in spite of countess Lidia Ivanovna &apos;s influence , and she avoided it .
And as to the profits , why , I must make what God gives .
Easy as it was to mow the wet , soft grass , it was hard work going up and down the steep sides of the ravine .
&quot; Now , how was it ?
We shall have time to talk a little over tea ; we &apos;ll have a cozy chat , eh ? &quot; she said in English to Anna , with a smile , pressing the hand with which she held a parasol .
Kitty was not married , but ill , and ill from love for a man who had slighted her .
And afterwards , how he had all at once broken out : he had associated with the most horrible people , and rushed into the most senseless debauchery .
K ... ha !
&quot; Alexander , Alexander , &quot; she whispered , moving to him and beginning to weep .
Levin did not approve of all this ; he did not believe it would be of any good to the patient .
&quot; It &apos;s a rest to waltz with you , &quot; he said to her , as they fell into the first slow steps of the waltz .
He had only just left the Countess Bonina , with whom he had danced the first half of the waltz , and , scanning his kingdom - that is to say , a few couples who had started dancing - he caught sight of Kitty , entering , and flew up to her with that peculiar , easy amble which is confined to directors of balls .
I have never blushed before anyone , and you force me to feel to blame for something . &quot; He looked at her and was struck by a new spiritual beauty in her face .
Is there ? &quot; answered Levin .
And having , whether he liked or not , taken up for himself the position of an independent man , he carried it off with great tact and good sense , behaving as though he bore no grudge against anyone , did not regard himself as injured in any way , and cared for nothing but to be left alone since he was enjoying himself .
Please manage that there may be no talk of my having shot myself on purpose . &quot; &quot; No one does say so .
&quot; They have chosen a time to talk , &quot; she was thinking .
After getting to know Varenka , Kitty became more and more fascinated by her friend , and every day she discovered new virtues in her .
&quot; How is it they don &apos;t take proper precautions ? &quot; said a third .
&quot; Are there bears on your place ? &quot; she added , turning her charming little head to him and smiling .
He felt this from the agonizing sensation of division that he experienced at that instant .
And again a vivid flush overspread her face .
She looked at Kitty , thinking how and when she would stand with Count Siniavin in Kitty &apos;s place , and how she would remind him then of his joke today .
When now her glance met his blue kindly eyes looking intently at her , it seemed to her that he saw right through her , and understood all that was not good that was passing within her .
Levin would have entered into conversation with him , but a bell rang for the servant , and he went out .
It shows that at last a reasonable and steady view of the matter is becoming prevalent among us . &quot; Having drunk his second cup of tea with cream , and bread , Alexey Alexandrovitch got up , and was going towards his study .
I feel that someone of our friends must have sent him : my health &apos;s so precious , it seems . &quot; &quot; No ; what did he say ? &quot; She questioned him about his health and what he had been doing , and tried to persuade him to take a rest and come out to her .
Levin sent for his bailiff , but immediately went off himself to look for him .
The peasants got ready for dinner .
Do you want anything ? &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch asked without eagerness .
I am glad .... Kitty ! &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve not been long settling things , &quot; said the old prince , trying to seem unmoved ; but Levin noticed that his eyes were wet when he turned to him .
I think he slipped in and ate one of them on the sly . &quot; The recollection of her son suddenly roused Anna from the helpless condition in which she found herself .
She did not walk , but seemed , by some unseen force , to float to him .
Oh , and where &apos;s Vronsky now ? &quot; he asked suddenly , laying down the soap .
I have to speak to you , &quot; he said , putting the portfolio under his arm , and squeezing it so tightly with his elbow that his shoulder stood up .
&quot; No , indeed , Konstantin Dmitrich !
What am I to say to him ?
Linon , said something to her , and went towards the pavilion where the ladies took off their skates .
Just now , with all her own cares , she &apos;s anxious about the Oblonskys being brought together . &quot; The Countess Lidia Ivanovna was a friend of her husband &apos;s , and the center of that one of the coteries of the Petersburg world with which Anna was , through her husband , in the closest relations .
And vast sums of money had actually been spent and were still being spent on this business , and utterly unproductively , and the whole business could obviously lead to nothing whatever .
She did not , as he saw , understand this work , she did not even care to understand it .
&quot; She has not slept all night , and the doctor advised her to go out .
Her husband was simply a superfluous and tiresome person .
Do you wish it ?
But you must understand , there are two women ; one insists only on her rights , and those rights are your love , which you can &apos;t give her ; and the other sacrifices everything for you and asks for nothing .
No , this won &apos;t do ; I must begin .
Obviously something unusual had happened .
&quot; I work , I want to do something , but I had forgotten it must all end ; I had forgotten - death . &quot; He sat on his bed in the darkness , crouched up , hugging his knees , and holding his breath from the strain of thought , he pondered .
And suddenly both of them felt that though they were friends , though they had been dining and drinking together , which should have drawn them closer , yet each was thinking only of his own affairs , and they had nothing to do with one another .
Yes , really ! &quot; &quot; Well , did you succeed ? &quot; &quot; Almost . &quot; &quot; You really must tell me about it , &quot; she said , getting up .
After looking at the portrait for a minute , Alexey Alexandrovitch shuddered so that his lips quivered and he uttered the sound &quot; brrr , &quot; and turned away .
Moving into the middle of the table a portfolio of papers , with a scarcely perceptible smile of self @-@ satisfaction , he took a pencil from a rack and plunged into the perusal of a complex report relating to the present complication .
Anna got into her bed , and lay expecting every minute that he would begin to speak to her again .
Vronsky was obliged to be his guide in satisfying both these inclinations .
Her eyes sparkled , and her rosy lips could not keep from smiling from the consciousness of her own attractiveness .
&quot; It &apos;s your own fault .
Going out into the corridor , he stopped short .
This intimacy had grown still closer during Levin &apos;s student days .
Mihailov again tried to say that that was how he understood Pilate , but his lips quivered intractably , and he could not pronounce the words .
&quot; How splendid , how nice he is ! &quot; Kitty was thinking at that time , as she came out of the pavilion with Mlle.
And their impoverishment is not due to extravagance - that would be nothing ; living in good style - that &apos;s the proper thing for noblemen ; it &apos;s only the nobles who know how to do it .
&quot; Yes , come along , &quot; answered Levin in ecstasy , hearing unceasingly the sound of that voice saying , &quot; Good @-@ bye till this evening , &quot; and seeing the smile with which it was said .
Kitty was unmistakably proud of playing the part of a sister of mercy in that family .
&quot; It &apos;s as well he &apos;s not attractive enough for Kitty to have fallen in love with him , &quot; thought the mother .
When she had finished , they all thanked her again , and went off to tea .
&quot; At first things were rather uncomfortable , but now we &apos;ve settled everything capitally - thanks to my old nurse , &quot; she said , indicating Marya Philimonovna , who , seeing that they were speaking of her , smiled brightly and cordially to Levin .
Altogether , Anna , on turning , after the departure of her guests , to the consideration of her attire , was very much annoyed .
&quot; What did you begin to tell me about the prince ?
&quot; Oh , no , &quot; said Kitty , and sat down at the table .
Sergey Ivanovitch wrote that he could not come himself , and in touching terms he begged his brother &apos;s forgiveness .
And more than all , it &apos;s a question of culture , which he is without . &quot; Vronsky defended Mihailov , but at the bottom of his heart he believed it , because in his view a man of a different , lower world would be sure to be envious .
&quot; I &apos;m told you have a side @-@ saddle , &quot; she wrote to him ; &quot; I hope you will bring it over yourself . &quot; This was more than he could stand .
He did not hear the sound of the shot , but a violent blow on his chest sent him reeling .
Mahotin would not let her pass that side .
Chapter 27 &quot; If I &apos;d only the heart to throw up what &apos;s been set going ... such a lot of trouble wasted ... I &apos;d turn my back on the whole business , sell up , go off like Nikolay Ivanovitch ... to hear _ La Belle Hélène _ , &quot; said the landowner , a pleasant smile lighting up his shrewd old face .
One consolatory reflection upon her conduct had occurred to her at the first moment of the final rupture , and when now she recalled all the past , she remembered that one reflection .
But hitherto she had not taken note of the feeling , now she was clearly and painfully aware of it .
It would have struck him as absurd if he had been told that he would not get a position with the salary he required , especially as he expected nothing out of the way ; he only wanted what the men of his own age and standing did get , and he was no worse qualified for performing duties of the kind than any other man .
And indeed , thank God , there &apos;s nothing to speak of , &quot; she told herself .
&quot; It can &apos;t go on .
He &apos;d been storing them up , the darling ! &quot; Vronsky burst into roars of laughter .
&quot; I must write that down , &quot; he thought .
&quot; I do not grieve for that .
She had never anticipated that the utterance of love would produce such a powerful effect on her .
Besides the gift of the necklace he wanted to arrange with her about meeting after the ballet .
Yegor departed , and Levin was left alone .
Ivan drove off to the road and fell into line with the other loaded carts .
But her pace never changed , and Vronsky , feeling a spatter of mud in his face , realized that he was once more the same distance from Gladiator .
&quot; And how is she - better ? &quot; Levin asked in agitation .
I have too much respect or contempt , or both ...
The family doctor listened attentively and respectfully .
&quot; I didn &apos;t want to see you for anything , &quot; he answered timidly .
&quot; What did I tell you ? &quot; said Anna &apos;s friend .
In such love there can be no sort of tragedy .
How will you answer him ?
She had been expecting him .
She said that He was pitying Pilate .
The snipe flying high above instantly folded its wings and fell into a thicket , bending down the delicate shoots .
Nikolay Dmitrievitch drinks a great deal , &quot; she said .
Both the guests and the outside public had by now passed through all the phases of anticipation .
Catching a sound of skirts and light steps at the door , she looked round , and her care @-@ worn face unconsciously expressed not gladness , but wonder .
All the impressions of the day , beginning with the impression made by the old peasant , which served , as it were , as the fundamental basis of all the conceptions and ideas of the day , threw Levin into violent excitement .
And the most awful thing about it is that it &apos;s all my fault - all my fault , though I &apos;m not to blame .
He did at once , and without the smallest effort , keep the promise he had made her - always to think well of all men , and to like everyone always .
It was the world in which his father and mother had lived and died .
&quot; Well , read this .
Nikolay was just getting ready to go , when Konstantin went in to him again and begged him , rather unnaturally , to forgive him if he had hurt his feelings in any way .
His thoughts were of the most various , but the end of all his thoughts was the same - death .
He has kept expecting you .
As a man who had seen something of life , and neither a fool nor an invalid , he had no faith in medicine , and in his heart was furious at the whole farce , specially as he was perhaps the only one who fully comprehended the cause of Kitty &apos;s illness .
&quot; I think you &apos;re giving way to pessimism .
What if Darya Alexandrovna told the truth ?
He knew that he would not see them during the race .
His wound had healed , and he was driving about making preparations for his departure for Tashkend .
&quot; No , stop a minute , stop a minute , &quot; he said .
Yes , just as you can only carry a _ fardeau _ and do something with your hands , when the _ fardeau _ is tied on your back , and that &apos;s marriage .
First @-@ rate ice - do put your skates on . &quot; &quot; I haven &apos;t got my skates , &quot; Levin answered , marveling at this boldness and ease in her presence , and not for one second losing sight of her , though he did not look at her .
Kitty felt how distasteful her father &apos;s warmth was to Levin after what had happened .
Before the servants he pressed her hand , took his seat in the carriage , and drove back to Petersburg .
What for ?
This lovely spring roused Levin still more , and strengthened him in his resolution of renouncing all his past and building up his lonely life firmly and independently .
The other slightly disagreeable fact was that the new head of his department , like all new heads , had the reputation already of a terrible person , who got up at six o &apos;clock in the morning , worked like a horse , and insisted on his subordinates working in the same way .
I &apos;m working . &quot; &quot; Ah ! &quot; said Vronsky , with sympathy ; &quot; let &apos;s go in . &quot; And with the habit common with Russians , instead of saying in Russian what he wanted to keep from the servants , he began to speak in French .
Not nice as she would have wished to look nice in old days at a ball , but nice for the object which she now had in view .
Vronsky at once divined that Golenishtchev was of this class , and therefore was doubly pleased to see him .
&quot; Perhaps I am mistaken , but believe me , what I say , I say as much for myself as for you .
He remembered his brother Nikolay , and felt ashamed and sore , and he scowled ; but Oblonsky began speaking of a subject which at once drew his attention .
&quot; No action has yet been taken , if I understand rightly .
Left alone , Alexey Alexandrovitch recognized that he had not the strength to keep up the line of firmness and composure any longer .
Often , looking at them , she would make every possible effort to persuade herself that she was mistaken , that she as a mother was partial to her children .
Supposing she had been older ...
&quot; Oh , I don &apos;t care ! &quot; she said .
Anna took the tray , and then pushed it away from her .
Now I &apos;m ever so much better , &quot; he said , rubbing his beard with his big thin hands .
I shall expect you , &quot; she finished .
He bared his muscular arms .
&quot; I slept badly , &quot; answered Anna , looking intently at the footman who came to meet them , and , as she supposed , brought Vronsky &apos;s note .
She said nothing , and shook her cropped head in dissent .
I &apos;ve been promising to go for a century , &quot; said Anna , to whom lying , alien as it was to her nature , had become not merely simple and natural in society , but a positive source of satisfaction .
A great deal more of what the gentleman with the gray whiskers said to show in what way Russia was ruined by the emancipation struck him indeed as very true , new to him , and quite incontestable .
Vronsky was of distinguished appearance ; he possessed , moreover , the art of behaving with respectful dignity , and was used to having to do with such grand personages - that was how he came to be put in charge of the prince .
But can they be sure ?
&quot; You &apos;re always like that , &quot; she answered , as though completely misapprehending him , and of all he had said only taking in the last phrase .
After the first waltz Kitty went to her mother , and she had hardly time to say a few words to Countess Nordston when Vronsky came up again for the first quadrille .
&quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; she said .
Seeing that Vronsky did not turn round , the young officer got up .
The face dearest to him , the face of Christ , the center of the picture , which had given him such ecstasy as it unfolded itself to him , was utterly lost to him when he glanced at the picture with their eyes .
Karenin himself had followed the Petersburg fashion for a dinner with ladies and was wearing evening dress and a white tie .
&quot; Ah , yes ! &quot; He bowed his head , and his handsome face assumed a harassed expression .
&quot; I think , &quot; he went on , &quot; that this attempt of the spiritualists to explain their marvels as some sort of new natural force is most futile .
She was thinking , just when he came upon her , of this : why was it , she wondered , that to others , to Betsy ( she knew of her secret connection with Tushkevitch ) it was all easy , while to her it was such torture ?
No , that &apos;s impossible .
It &apos;s only the French who can do that . &quot; Chapter 6 Princess Betsy drove home from the theater , without waiting for the end of the last act .
&quot; Uncover your face - look at him !
She ought to be beloved , and nothing more .
I have come here now to hear about Kitty , and then I shall shut myself up entirely , if - God forbid - it should be scarlatina . &quot; The old prince too had come in from his study after the doctor &apos;s departure , and after presenting his cheek to Dolly , and saying a few words to her , he turned to his wife : &quot; How have you settled it ?
Put on skates , and let us skate together . &quot; &quot; Skate together !
what have I done , what have I said ?
But he had always wanted to be good .
But the more intensely he thought , the clearer it became to him that it was indubitably so , that in reality , looking upon life , he had forgotten one little fact - that death will come , and all ends ; that nothing was even worth beginning , and that there was no helping it anyway .
&quot; And your nurse is simply charming !
Alexey Alexandrovitch escorted her out .
I &apos;m certain he was in love with you , and would still be in love with you , if it hadn &apos;t .... &quot; Oh , the most awful thing of all for me is this sympathizing ! &quot; shrieked Kitty , suddenly flying into a passion .
&quot; What have you done ?
The evening before , Countess Lidia Ivanovna had sent him a pamphlet by a celebrated traveler in China , who was staying in Petersburg , and with it she enclosed a note begging him to see the traveler himself , as he was an extremely interesting person from various points of view , and likely to be useful .
Kitty answered perfectly truly .
The only change Vronsky detected in him was that subdued , continual radiance of beaming content which settles on the faces of men who are successful and are sure of the recognition of their success by everyone .
&quot; It &apos;s on the wing ....
This was the second letter he had received from Marya Nikolaevna .
I feel myself better , purer .
Chapter 29 The carrying out of Levin &apos;s plan presented many difficulties ; but he struggled on , doing his utmost , and attained a result which , though not what he desired , was enough to enable him , without self @-@ deception , to believe that the attempt was worth the trouble .
There &apos;ll be plenty for the beasts . &quot; &quot; What do you think about the weather ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s in God &apos;s hands .
When he went in to the sick man , his eyes and his attention were unconsciously dimmed , and he did not see and did not distinguish the details of his brother &apos;s position .
He felt much nearer to him than to his brother , and could not help smiling at the affection he felt for this man .
But he talked to them , simply trying to reconcile and soften their differences .
The one is in close connection with the other , one must attack both sides at once . &quot; &quot; And how about a tour abroad ? &quot; asked the family doctor .
For God &apos;s sake , on my knees , I implore you ! &quot; &quot; If you so much wish it , I will come , &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch , sighing .
All necessary preparations shall be made for your arrival here .
Moreover , Sergey Ivanovitch &apos;s attitude to the peasants rather piqued Konstantin .
Today and this morning and all past days and days to come , &quot; she said .
This chance did not present itself , and till the beginning of June Darya Alexandrovna stayed alone in the country .
&quot; I meant to come , but Varenka said that Anna Pavlovna sent word you were not going . &quot; &quot; Not going ! &quot; said Petrov , blushing , and immediately beginning to cough , and his eyes sought his wife .
It was only then , for the first time , that he clearly understood what he had not understood when he led her out of the church after the wedding .
But he felt helpless ; he knew beforehand that everyone was against him , and that he would not be allowed to do what seemed to him now so natural and right , but would be forced to do what was wrong , though it seemed the proper thing to them .
I ... if I wanted to , I don &apos;t know what to say or how ....
&quot; Splendid !
Kitty &apos;s here .
Very probably the good @-@ looking face of the young woman in the clogs had a good deal to do with the impression of well @-@ being this peasant household made upon Levin , but the impression was so strong that Levin could never get rid of it .
what an idea !
While he was governor of a province , Anna &apos;s aunt , a wealthy provincial lady , had thrown him - middle @-@ aged as he was , though young for a governor - with her niece , and had succeeded in putting him in such a position that he had either to declare himself or to leave the town .
In the habitual conditions of her life she felt again resolute and irreproachable .
To be in the sick @-@ room was agony to him , not to be there still worse .
Horribly vulgar !
Vronsky , meanwhile , in spite of the complete realization of what he had so long desired , was not perfectly happy .
No doubt they talked of me together , or , worse still , they were silent .
What he considered necessary was to cover all the furniture with cretonne , to put up curtains , to weed the garden , to make a little bridge on the pond , and to plant flowers .
now I won &apos;t descend to that .
&quot; Love those that hate you , but to love those one hates is impossible .
He pressed the little hand she gave him , and was delighted , as though at something special , by the energetic squeeze with which she freely and vigorously shook his hand .
&quot; There , you never know how to say such pretty things , &quot; said the baroness , turning to Petritsky .
&quot; I mix with all the neighboring landowners , who are cultivating their land on a rational system ; they all , with rare exceptions , are doing so at a loss .
A heavy , lowering storm cloud had blown up , and big raindrops were falling .
My son is going to my sister &apos;s , &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch , with an effort recalling what he had meant to say about his son .
I don &apos;t like her husband , but I like her very much . &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you like her husband ?
He had spoken courteously , deferentially , yet so firmly , so stubbornly , that for a long while she could make no answer .
She smiled at his praise , and continued to look about the room over his shoulder .
Just as they were going out of the station the station @-@ master overtook Vronsky .
Levin was confirmed in this generalization by observing that his brother did not take questions affecting the public welfare or the question of the immortality of the soul a bit more to heart than he did chess problems , or the ingenious construction of a new machine .
&quot; Well , the hay !
He , who had in her opinion such a marked aptitude for a political career , in which he would have been certain to play a leading part - he had sacrificed his ambition for her sake , and never betrayed the slightest regret .
&quot; I would do one thing , Alexey Alexandrovitch .
But that &apos;s not to the point ; what is to the point is a correction I must make in your comparison .
Chapter 12 The young Princess Kitty Shtcherbatskaya was eighteen .
Kitty was still a child when Levin left the university .
Then there was private business of his own , a visit from the doctor and the steward who managed his property .
I have spoiled ... I &apos;ve been the cause of that ball being a torture to her instead of a pleasure .
Tonight I don &apos;t advise you to speak , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch .
Three minutes later Levin ran full speed into the corridor , not looking at his watch for fear of aggravating his sufferings .
How simple and natural were her words , and how likely that she was simply sleepy !
&quot; I have only to go stubbornly on towards my aim , and I shall attain my end , &quot; thought Levin ; &quot; and it &apos;s something to work and take trouble for .
He perceived that it was no good talking to the old man , and that the principal person in the house was the mother .
That &apos;s as it ought to be .
Consequently the distributors of earthly blessings in the shape of places , rents , shares , and such , were all his friends , and could not overlook one of their own set ; and Oblonsky had no need to make any special exertion to get a lucrative post .
&quot; We &apos;ll go to Italy ; you will get strong , &quot; he said .
This shrewd man &apos;s flattering words , the naïve , childlike affection shown her by Liza Merkalova , and all the social atmosphere she was used to , - it was all so easy , and what was in store for her was so difficult , that she was for a minute in uncertainty whether to remain , whether to put off a little longer the painful moment of explanation .
And he added unexpectedly : &quot; But perhaps you are right .
&quot; A pretty sharp fellow this Fomin must be , &quot; said Grinevitch of one of the persons taking part in the case they were examining .
It even struck him as strange that they should be so eager to talk of what was of no use to anyone .
And he wrote three letters .
He could be heard getting up hurriedly , stumbling against something , and Levin saw , facing him in the doorway , the big , scared eyes , and the huge , thin , stooping figure of his brother , so familiar , and yet astonishing in its weirdness and sickliness .
Succor and comfort you will find not in me , though I have come only to aid you if I can .
She had been on the lookout for her , glancing at her watch every minute , and , as so often happens , let slip just that minute when her visitor arrived , so that she did not hear the bell .
&quot; I must inform her of my conclusion , that thinking over the terrible position in which she has placed her family , all other solutions will be worse for both sides than an external _ status quo _ , and that such I agree to retain , on the strict condition of obedience on her part to my wishes , that is to say , cessation of all intercourse with her lover . &quot; When this decision had been finally adopted , another weighty consideration occurred to Alexey Alexandrovitch in support of it .
&quot; I am not expressing my own opinion of either form of culture , &quot; Sergey Ivanovitch said , holding out his glass with a smile of condescension , as to a child .
He had begun sitting up again , coughing , had begun eating again , talking again , and again had ceased to talk of death , again had begun to express hope of his recovery , and had become more irritable and more gloomy than ever .
This can all be stopped and set right . &quot; &quot; What ?
I never can say the name , &quot; said the Englishman , over his shoulder , pointing his big finger and dirty nail towards Gladiator &apos;s stall .
though the color takes after the father ; but that &apos;s nothing .
But she was still the same , and the sight of her affected him the same way , physically reviving him , stirring him , and filling his soul with rapture .
I want a divorce , but the form in which it is possible is of great consequence to me .
This was the class of old @-@ fashioned and ridiculous people .
During the ceremony Nikolay Levin prayed fervently .
&quot; So it is all settled !
And the happiness of forgiveness has revealed to me my duty .
He went towards the mounds , whence came the clank of the chains of sledges as they slipped down or were dragged up , the rumble of the sliding sledges , and the sounds of merry voices .
&quot; What is this word ? &quot; he said , pointing to the _ n _ that stood for _ never _ .
No doubt he was in a pitiable position , but how could that be helped ?
&quot; The hay will be spoiled , &quot; he said .
He had eaten nothing for a whole day , he had not slept for two nights , had spent several hours undressed in the frozen air , and felt not simply fresher and stronger than ever , but felt utterly independent of his body ; he moved without muscular effort , and felt as if he could do anything .
She does not exist for me .... &quot; Everything relating to her and her son , towards whom his sentiments were as much changed as towards her , ceased to interest him .
In his attitude to her there was a shade of vexation , but nothing more .
But to think of anything extraneous was an agonizing effort .
Someone stooped down and pulled out the bride &apos;s train .
Stepan Arkadyevitch &apos;s eyes asked : &quot; Why do you tell me that ?
The little girl , her father &apos;s favorite , ran up boldly , embraced him , and hung laughingly on his neck , enjoying as she always did the smell of scent that came from his whiskers .
Walking was as difficult as on a bog , and by the time Levin had ended the row he was in a great heat , and he stopped and gave up the sieve to Vassily .
Kitty did not speak nor lift her eyes .
Either I am loath to leave her , or I see she &apos;s dull alone .
&quot; One needs to know and love her as I have loved her to discover the very sweetest expression of her soul , &quot; Vronsky thought , though it was only from this portrait that he had himself learned this sweetest expression of her soul .
She shivered , both from the cold and from the inward horror which had clutched her with fresh force in the open air .
another examination ! &quot; cried the mother , with horror .
I beg you to note that I attach particular significance to compliance with this request .
When they went out the Vronsky &apos;s carriage had already driven away .
Alexey Alexandrovitch , scowling with emotion , muttered something to himself , and made no answer .
&quot; Don &apos;t say it !
Spring was slow in unfolding .
In spite of death , he felt the need of life and love .
Levin frowned , shook hands coldly , and at once turned to Oblonsky .
&quot; Mind &apos;ee , &quot; repeated the old man .
Levin certainly was out of humor , and in spite of all his desire to be affectionate and cordial to his charming visitor , he could not control his mood .
But you and I have one important advantage over them for certain , in being more difficult to buy .
Levin was only waiting for the delivery of his wheat to receive the money for it and go abroad .
She had not looked for such cruelty in her sister , and she was angry with her .
If I remain in the army , I lose nothing .
They did not remember their father , and their mother died when Alexey Alexandrovitch was ten years old .
His confession of unbelief passed unnoticed .
&quot; What was it ? &quot; &quot; Oh , nothing , &quot; Konstantin answered in confusion .
She flung herself on the body .
He speaks well .
When he woke up , instead of news of his brother &apos;s death which he expected , he learned that the sick man had returned to his earlier condition .
She did not sleep all night .
You know what we &apos;re speaking of ? &quot; said Levin , piercing him with his eyes .
His young wife , so Venden told the story - he had been married half a year - was at church with her mother , and suddenly overcome by indisposition , arising from her interesting condition , she could not remain standing , she drove home in the first sledge , a smart @-@ looking one , she came across .
I hope that now you will leave him .
&quot; The most transcendental ideas seem to be within my grasp when he &apos;s speaking . &quot; &quot; Oh , yes ! &quot; said Anna , radiant with a smile of happiness , and not understanding a word of what Betsy had said .
Still less could Levin say that he was a knave , as Sviazhsky was unmistakably an honest , good @-@ hearted , sensible man , who worked good @-@ humoredly , keenly , and perseveringly at his work ; he was held in high honor by everyone about him , and certainly he had never consciously done , and was indeed incapable of doing , anything base .
She was near her confinement .
&quot; The doctor said it was nothing serious , and he ordered a bath , sir . &quot; &quot; But she is still in pain , &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch , listening to the baby &apos;s screaming in the next room .
He was flying towards the Irish barricade , Frou @-@ Frou and he both together saw the barricade in the distance , and both the man and the mare had a moment &apos;s hesitation .
Now what &apos;s to be done ?
&quot; I intended ...
The Countess Nordston pounced upon Levin at once .
Vronsky gave his mother his arm ; but just as they were getting out of the carriage several men ran suddenly by with panic @-@ stricken faces .
He looked at people as if they were things .
Vronsky ! &quot; shouted Petritsky , jumping up , scraping his chair .
What pleased her most of all was that she saw clearly what all the women admired more than anything was her having so many children , and such fine ones .
He &apos;s a hero , in fact , &quot; said Anna , smiling and recollecting the two hundred roubles he had given at the station .
&quot; Oh , good @-@ bye then .
When Anna was passing the top of the staircase , a servant was running up to announce the visitor , while the visitor himself was standing under a lamp .
As is invariably the case , after they had been asked at what price they wanted rooms , it appeared that there was not one decent room for them ; one decent room had been taken by the inspector of railroads , another by a lawyer from Moscow , a third by Princess Astafieva from the country .
&quot; Pray to God and beseech Him .
He was in front of all , and cut his wide row without bending , as though playing with the scythe .
But that &apos;s no matter .
&quot; Oh , I say , are you going tonight to our people , the Shtcherbatskys , &quot; I mean ? &quot; he said , his eyes sparkling significantly as he pushed away the empty rough shells , and drew the cheese towards him .
He asked for exemplary punishment .
&quot; If the story of such a girl were thoroughly sifted , you would find she had abandoned a family - her own or a sister &apos;s , where she might have found a woman &apos;s duties , &quot; Darya Alexandrovna broke in unexpectedly in a tone of exasperation , probably suspecting what sort of girl Stepan Arkadyevitch was thinking of .
You wouldn &apos;t believe how uncomfortable &quot; ( he laid stress on the word _ uncomfortable _ ) &quot; it is to dine alone . &quot; At dinner he talked a little to his wife about Moscow matters , and , with a sarcastic smile , asked her after Stepan Arkadyevitch ; but the conversation was for the most part general , dealing with Petersburg official and public news .
They sent finally to the Shtcherbatskys &quot; to unpack the things .
The old man who had been sitting beside him had long ago gone home ; the people had all separated .
She had immediately made friends with the bailiff &apos;s wife , and on the very first day she drank tea with her and the bailiff under the acacias , and reviewed all the circumstances of the position .
&quot; We shall have time to finish after lunch , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch .
Because the peasants are just as much slaves as they ever were , and that &apos;s why you and Sergey Ivanovitch don &apos;t like people to try and get them out of their slavery , &quot; said Nikolay Levin , exasperated by the objection .
They had nothing to talk about , as was almost always the case at this time , and laying her hand on the table she kept opening and shutting it , and laughed herself as she watched her action .
Alexey Alexandrovitch entered into conversation with him .
The mile @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half race was just finishing , and all eyes were fixed on the horse @-@ guard in front and the light hussar behind , urging their horses on with a last effort close to the winning post .
But now Anna was eager to go , in the hope of seeing Vronsky .
That mist which covers everything in that blissful time when childhood is just ending , and out of that vast circle , happy and gay , there is a path growing narrower and narrower , and it is delightful and alarming to enter the ballroom , bright and splendid as it is .... Who has not been through it ? &quot; Kitty smiled without speaking .
&quot; It &apos;s I , &quot; answered Konstantin Levin , coming forward into the light .
Anna went out into society , as she had always done , was particularly often at Princess Betsy &apos;s , and met Vronsky everywhere .
But realizing that in asking this the Englishman had been looking at him not as an employer , but as a jockey , he answered : &quot; I &apos;ve got to go to Bryansky &apos;s ; I shall be home within an hour . &quot; &quot; How often I &apos;m asked that question today ! &quot; he said to himself , and he blushed , a thing which rarely happened to him .
&quot; I tell you what we &apos;ll do tomorrow .
&quot; How do you know ? &quot; &quot; Prokofy saw him in the street . &quot; &quot; Here in Moscow ?
There was an interval between the races , and so nothing hindered conversation .
&quot; Here are my saviors ! &quot; cried Petritsky , seeing them come in .
Chapter 7 Stephan Arkadyevitch had gone to Petersburg to perform the most natural and essential official duty - so familiar to everyone in the government service , though incomprehensible to outsiders - that duty , but for which one could hardly be in government service , of reminding the ministry of his existence - and having , for the due performance of this rite , taken all the available cash from home , was gaily and agreeably spending his days at the races and in the summer villas .
What kind of bird may it be , pray ? &quot; added Ryabinin , looking contemptuously at the snipe : &quot; a great delicacy , I suppose . &quot; And he shook his head disapprovingly , as though he had grave doubts whether this game were worth the candle .
&quot; I want to know what she would like , &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch .
If it were a common , vulgar , worldly intrigue , they would have left me alone .
&quot; I can do nothing .
&quot; Have you been here long ? &quot; &quot; I have just come , and very much wanted to see you , &quot; said Levin , looking shyly and at the same time angrily and uneasily around .
Levin saw that he still hoped .
She felt as though everything were beginning to be double in her soul , just as objects sometimes appear double to over @-@ tired eyes .
He tried to read , but he could not revive the very vivid interest he had felt before in Egyptian hieroglyphics .
That &apos;s the hare .
Most of all , it was a golden bridge for return .
&quot; Listen to me .
&quot; Oh , if you want to so much , I &apos;ll find out about her first and make her acquaintance myself , &quot; answered her mother .
&quot; My husband says there are few statesmen like him in Europe . &quot; &quot; And my husband tells me just the same , but I don &apos;t believe it , &quot; said Princess Myakaya .
He felt that the husband was magnanimous even in his sorrow , while he had been base and petty in his deceit .
Chapter 22 Stepan Arkadyevitch , with the same somewhat solemn expression with which he used to take his presidential chair at his board , walked into Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s room .
With a wave of his short tail he disappeared from Vronsky &apos;s sight .
No , no , go away , you &apos;re too good ! &quot; She held his hand in one burning hand , while she pushed him away with the other .
&quot; Why should she suffer as I am suffering ? &quot; he thought .
Levin went back to his hotel , and was dismayed at the thought that all alone now with his impatience he had ten hours still left to get through .
&quot; I imagine that such a view has a foundation in the very nature of things , &quot; he said , and would have gone on to the drawing @-@ room .
Why do you always look down on me and Matvey ? &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , smiling hardly perceptibly , and addressing his wife .
&quot; My race is a harder one , &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch responded deferentially .
How you startled me ! &quot; she responded .
Darya Alexandrovna &apos;s words about forgiveness had aroused in him nothing but annoyance .
Again , just as at the first moment of hearing of her rupture with her husband , Vronsky , on reading the letter , was unconsciously carried away by the natural sensation aroused in him by his own relation to the betrayed husband .
&quot; When did anybody ever sell anything without being told immediately after the sale , &quot; It was worth much more &quot; ?
With a slight inclination of her head she passed , hearing behind her Stepan Arkadyevitch &apos;s loud voice calling him to come up , and the quiet , soft , and composed voice of Vronsky refusing .
In spite of the fact that , preparing herself for meeting him , she had schooled herself to despise and reproach him , she did not know what to say to him , and she felt sorry for him .
&quot; I have to go on to Madame Berthe &apos;s ; she asked me to . &quot; Kitty held her by the hand , and with passionate curiosity and entreaty her eyes asked her : &quot; What is it , what is this of such importance that gives you such tranquillity ?
&quot; Ah !
The sole difference lay in the fact that he was more busily occupied than ever .
An hour later Anna , with Golenishtchev by her side and Vronsky on the front seat of the carriage , facing them , drove up to a new ugly house in the remote suburb .
One would think you were afraid my society would compromise you .
Nice !
This he knew positively , and had known a long while , ever since he had begun to paint it .
Three days after the quarrel , Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch Oblonsky - Stiva , as he was called in the fashionable world - woke up at his usual hour , that is , at eight o &apos;clock in the morning , not in his wife &apos;s bedroom , but on the leather @-@ covered sofa in his study .
But neither the first nor the second nor the third course was possible .
Believe he could not , and at the same time he had no firm conviction that it was all wrong .
He had even supposed that she , a worn @-@ out woman no longer young or good @-@ looking , and in no way remarkable or interesting , merely a good mother , ought from a sense of fairness to take an indulgent view .
Yes , Alabin was giving a dinner on glass tables , and the tables sang , _ Il mio tesoro _ - not _ Il mio tesoro _ though , but something better , and there were some sort of little decanters on the table , and they were women , too , &quot; he remembered .
&quot; Please invite me to the wedding . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in love now . &quot; &quot; Yes , with a cuttlefish !
And suddenly a strange feeling came upon him .
Sergey Ivanovitch was for a minute surprised at this unexpected view of the subject ; but he promptly made a new plan of attack .
&quot; Yes , I can see that his position is awful ; it &apos;s worse for the guilty than the innocent , &quot; she said , &quot; if he feels that all the misery comes from his fault .
&quot; Why do you ask me ?
&quot; Come , master , dinner time ! &quot; he said briskly .
Formerly they had wardships , courts of justice , now they have the district council - not in the form of bribes , but in the form of unearned salary , &quot; he said , as hotly as though someone of those present had opposed his opinion .
&quot; And n ... and now ? &quot; he asked .
Vronsky felt , too , how powerful Serpuhovskoy might become through his unmistakable faculty for thinking things out and for taking things in , through his intelligence and gift of words , so rarely met with in the world in which he moved .
But why she had spoken of old Madame Vrede , whom she had to go and see , as she had to see many other people , she could not have explained ; and yet , as it afterwards turned out , had she contrived the most cunning devices to meet Vronsky , she could have thought of nothing better .
Kitty was walking there with her mother and the Moscow colonel , smart and jaunty in his European coat , bought ready @-@ made at Frankfort .
His brilliant black eyes were looking straight at the excited country gentleman with gray whiskers , and apparently he derived amusement from his remarks .
&quot; What have the wenches to do ?
The panics that had been lived through , the thoughts that had been brooded over , the money that had been wasted , and the disputes with her husband over marrying the two elder girls , Darya and Natalia !
&quot; How is mamma ? &quot; he asked , passing his hand over his daughter &apos;s smooth , soft little neck .
I ...
Do me that favor , I beseech you ! &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch pondered , and Stepan Arkadyevitch looked at him sympathetically , without interrupting his silence .
&quot; Lunch , sir , &quot; said the old man .
Chapter 19 The mistake made by Alexey Alexandrovitch in that , when preparing for seeing his wife , he had overlooked the possibility that her repentance might be sincere , and he might forgive her , and she might not die - this mistake was two months after his return from Moscow brought home to him in all its significance .
&quot; How glad I am to meet you ! &quot; said Vronsky , showing his strong white teeth in a friendly smile .
&quot; And here &apos;s my opinion for you .
&quot; Come , lads , keep it up ! &quot; said Tit , and ran on ahead almost at a trot .
&quot; A man brought it from Princess Tverskaya . &quot; Vronsky opened the letter , and flushed crimson .
&quot; He &apos;s made a start .... You swing it too wide , you &apos;ll tire yourself out ....
And in spite of the complete , as he supposed , contempt and indifference he now felt for his wife , at the bottom of his heart Alexey Alexandrovitch still had one feeling left in regard to her - a disinclination to see her free to throw in her lot with Vronsky , so that her crime would be to her advantage .
He thought of nothing , wished for nothing , but not to be left behind the peasants , and to do his work as well as possible .
That feeling was an intimate , familiar feeling , like a consciousness of hypocrisy , which she experienced in her relations with her husband .
&quot; You &apos;re of the Kiev university ? &quot; said Konstantin Levin to Kritsky , to break the awkward silence that followed .
_ Together , _ she said ; _ let us skate together ! _ Speak to her now ?
But to him , knowing her , knowing that whenever he went to bed five minutes later than usual , she noticed it , and asked him the reason ; to him , knowing that every joy , every pleasure and pain that she felt she communicated to him at once ; to him , now to see that she did not care to notice his state of mind , that she did not care to say a word about herself , meant a great deal .
&quot; Nervous irritability , &quot; he said to the princess , when Kitty had left the room .
Suddenly she heard an even , tranquil snore .
Her position , which had seemed to her simplified the night before , suddenly struck her now as not only not simple , but as absolutely hopeless .
&quot; All or one ? &quot; And not assisting the harassed young man she was dancing with in the conversation , the thread of which he had lost and could not pick up again , she obeyed with external liveliness the peremptory shouts of Korsunsky starting them all into the _ grand rond _ , and then into the _ chaîne _ , and at the same time she kept watch with a growing pang at her heart .
Yes , to Moscow by the evening train .
He saw just the same thing in the socialistic books : either they were the beautiful but impracticable fantasies which had fascinated him when he was a student , or they were attempts at improving , rectifying the economic position in which Europe was placed , with which the system of land tenure in Russia had nothing in common .
The humiliation of his rejection stung him to the heart , as though it were a fresh wound he had only just received .
Directly Vronsky went towards her , she drew in a deep breath , and , turning back her prominent eye till the white looked bloodshot , she started at the approaching figures from the opposite side , shaking her muzzle , and shifting lightly from one leg to the other .
Now she wrote quite differently .
She could not guess that that expression arose from the first idea that presented itself to Vronsky - that a duel was now inevitable .
Alexey Alexandrovitch was not jealous .
He took off his skates , and overtook the mother and daughter at the entrance of the gardens .
With his characteristic quickwittedness he caught the drift of each innuendo , divined whence it came , at whom and on what ground it was aimed , and that afforded him , as it always did , a certain satisfaction .
&quot; I lodge complaints ?
Her husband might put her to shame and turn her out , Vronsky might grow cold to her and go on living his own life apart ( she thought of him again with bitterness and reproach ) ; she could not leave her son .
The most fundamental idea , the idea of existence , has not been received by me through sensation ; indeed , there is no special sense @-@ organ for the transmission of such an idea . &quot; &quot; Yes , but they - Wurt , and Knaust , and Pripasov - would answer that your consciousness of existence is derived from the conjunction of all your sensations , that that consciousness of existence is the result of your sensations .
I say political economy ; you say - worse .
The young wife flung the rake up on the load , and with a bold step , swinging her arms , she went to join the women , who were forming a ring for the haymakers &quot; dance .
Your new white frock !
&quot; Delighted to see you , &quot; said Princess Shtcherbatskaya .
&quot; I understand , I understand , &quot; he interrupted her , taking the letter , but not reading it , and trying to soothe her .
She had not been near Anna again since the beginning of the evening , and now again she saw her suddenly quite new and surprising .
&quot; But what are we to lay down as the outward signs of true civilization ? &quot; said Pestsov .
I want to enrich medicine with a new word : _ Arbeitskur _ . &quot; &quot; Well , but you don &apos;t need it , I should fancy . &quot; &quot; No , but for all sorts of nervous invalids . &quot; &quot; Yes , it ought to be tried .
We have no machines , no good stock , no efficient supervision ; we don &apos;t even know how to keep accounts .
Once or twice she stole a look at him , as though asking him , &quot; Is it what I think ? &quot; &quot; I understand , &quot; she said , flushing a little .
But there had been an important and joyful event : Pava , his best cow , an expensive beast , bought at a show , had calved .
What Vronsky attacked first as being the easiest was his pecuniary position .
He stood still , gazing at her in ecstasy .
The princess thought everything delightful , and in spite of her established position in Russian society , she tried abroad to be like a European fashionable lady , which she was not - for the simple reason that she was a typical Russian gentlewoman ; and so she was affected , which did not altogether suit her .
Chapter 23 Vronsky and Kitty waltzed several times round the room .
When she went upstairs to dress , and looked into the looking @-@ glass , she noticed with joy that it was one of her good days , and that she was in complete possession of all her forces , - she needed this so for what lay before her : she was conscious of external composure and free grace in her movements .
Shtcherbatsky told the old maid of honor , Madame Nikolaeva , that he meant to put the crown on Kitty &apos;s chignon for luck .
In the books on political economy - in Mill , for instance , whom he studied first with great ardor , hoping every minute to find an answer to the questions that were engrossing him - he found laws deduced from the condition of land culture in Europe ; but he did not see why these laws , which did not apply in Russia , must be general .
It &apos;s not I that am to blame , &quot; he told himself , &quot; but she .
And this was the only thing that interested him .
Taken : worse .
He knew only that he had told her the truth , that he had come where she was , that all the happiness of his life , the only meaning in life for him , now lay in seeing and hearing her .
Not far from her they were taking the rug off the lop @-@ eared Gladiator .
&quot; She &apos;s so much to be pitied , poor child , so much to be pitied , and you don &apos;t feel how it hurts her to hear the slightest reference to the cause of it .
He went up to her , bowed , and held out his hand without speaking .
&quot; What &apos;s that cry ? &quot; asked Oblonsky , drawing Levin &apos;s attention to a prolonged cry , as though a colt were whinnying in a high voice , in play .
I &apos;ve met them so little .
He went to a big ball in a new helmet .
The real spring had come .
&quot; Why do you think so ? &quot; Levin asked her , when she had followed him into the corridor .
He had forgotten , as he always forgot , the pictures he had finished .
&quot; I shall never marry . &quot; &quot; Well , then , I shall never come . &quot; &quot; Well , then , I shall be married simply for that .
It was all so simple , but he took it so awkwardly , and was so long thanking me , that I felt awkward too .
when will it end ?
Like what she used to be , or like what she was in the carriage ?
&quot; Why was it none would give it , then ? &quot; &quot; Why , because he has an understanding with the merchants ; he &apos;s bought them off .
Levin felt that , in spite of all the ugliness of his life , his brother Nikolay , in his soul , in the very depths of his soul , was no more in the wrong than the people who despised him .
&quot; I don &apos;t know why there aren &apos;t laws against such base , dishonorable people . &quot; &quot; Ah , I can &apos;t bear to hear you ! &quot; said the prince gloomily , getting up from his low chair , and seeming anxious to get away , yet stopping in the doorway .
All were silent .
Stepan Arkadyevitch was on familiar terms with almost all his acquaintances , and called almost all of them by their Christian names : old men of sixty , boys of twenty , actors , ministers , merchants , and adjutant @-@ generals , so that many of his intimate chums were to be found at the extreme ends of the social ladder , and would have been very much surprised to learn that they had , through the medium of Oblonsky , something in common .
Marya Nikolaevna felt his feet .
But he did not pursue the speculation , and without replying , he fell to musing on a quite different and personal matter .
She recalled the partly sincere , though greatly exaggerated , rôle of the mother living for her child , which she had taken up of late years , and she felt with joy that in the plight in which she found herself she had a support , quite apart from her relation to her husband or to Vronsky .
The oats were not yet spoiled .
&quot; You know my name ? &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch resumed .
Today all the significance of his book rose before him with special distinctness , and whole periods ranged themselves in his mind in illustration of his theories .
She caused me all sorts of worries . &quot; But he did not say what the annoyances were .
But you always mow sooner .
All we can do to keep our own !
He had known at the bottom of his heart that he would see her here today .
I do believe I &apos;ve seen it a hundred times , and always with fresh enjoyment .
And he too was softened ; he snatched her plump hand and proceeded to kiss it .
And she went to the writing @-@ table to write him another letter .
And please never speak of it , and tell everyone so .
It was evident that ample supplies of beefsteak , truffles , and Burgundy never failed to reach him at the fitting hour .
I can &apos;t .
First , I solved two chess problems , and one a very pretty one - a pawn opening .
&quot; You talk of his being an aristocrat .
She took no interest in the people she knew , feeling that nothing fresh would come of them .
Although he did go more or less into Petersburg society , his love affairs had always hitherto been outside it .
&quot; It is a misfortune which may befall anyone .
Of all the Gospel those words are the only ones remembered .
Ah !
The simplicity , the purity , the sanity of this life he felt clearly , and he was convinced he would find in it the content , the peace , and the dignity , of the lack of which he was so miserably conscious .
&quot; Oh , poor things ! &quot; &quot; Yes , papa , &quot; answered Kitty .
&quot; What a good thing I told him all ! &quot; She glanced at her watch .
He regarded Russia as a ruined country , rather after the style of Turkey , and the government of Russia as so bad that he never permitted himself to criticize its doings seriously , and yet he was a functionary of that government and a model marshal of nobility , and when he drove about he always wore the cockade of office and the cap with the red band .
How can I take her away now , when I have no money ?
At balls he danced principally with her .
On the morning , however , all was happily arranged , and towards ten o &apos;clock - the time at which they had asked the priest to wait for them for the mass - the children in their new dresses , with beaming faces , stood on the step before the carriage waiting for their mother .
Then he began being in love with the second .
&quot; Oh , I really don &apos;t understand !
&quot; No , Alexey Alexandrovitch ; I brought Anna and I promised to take her home , &quot; put in Betsy .
&quot; I &apos;d been meaning to tell you something for a long while , mamma : did you know that Levin meant to make Kitty an offer when he was here the last time ?
Did you really hear it yourself ? &quot; Levin saw that he was not to discover the connection between this man &apos;s life and his thoughts .
&quot; The last , dad ! &quot; the lad shouted back , pulling in the horse , and , smiling , he looked round at a bright , rosy @-@ checked peasant girl who sat in the cart smiling too , and drove on .
He turned white , would have said something , but stopped ; he dropped her hand , and his head sank on his breast .
And this made it still more painful for Levin .
She had a vision of being turned out of the house , of her shame being proclaimed to all the world .
He forgot the disagreeable impression of their last meeting , and with a face of frank delight held out his hand to his old comrade .
it would have been better , &quot; she said , and silent tears flowed down both her cheeks ; but she tried to smile , so as not to wound him .
He forgave Vronsky , and pitied him , especially after reports reached him of his despairing action .
The horse sank in up to the pasterns , and he drew each hoof with a sucking sound out of the half @-@ thawed ground .
He did not acknowledge this feeling , but at the bottom of his heart he longed for her to suffer for having destroyed his peace of mind - his honor .
Do you suppose I can be at peace , knowing you have a trouble I am not sharing ?
He would provoke them and set them off .
But what can be their aim ?
&quot; Splendid , splendid ! &quot; he said , lighting a fat cigar after the roast .
The approach of the train was more and more evident by the preparatory bustle in the station , the rush of porters , the movement of policemen and attendants , and people meeting the train .
&quot; I &apos;ll go to her ; I &apos;ll ask her ; I &apos;ll say for the last time : we are free , and hadn &apos;t we better stay so ?
That morning was a very full one for Alexey Alexandrovitch .
That year Countess Lidia Ivanovna declined to settle in Peterhof , was not once at Anna Arkadyevna &apos;s , and in conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch hinted at the unsuitability of Anna &apos;s close intimacy with Betsy and Vronsky .
But his wife might wonder why he did not go to her as usual ; and so , overcoming his disinclination , he went towards the bedroom .
You &apos;ve grown so pretty .
The Tsar and the whole court and crowds of people were all gazing at them - at him , and Mahotin a length ahead of him , as they drew near the &quot; devil , &quot; as the solid barrier was called .
On the way home from the races she had told her husband the truth in a moment of excitement , and in spite of the agony she had suffered in doing so , she was glad of it .
She was not merely doubting herself , she felt emotion at the thought of Vronsky , and was going away sooner than she had meant , simply to avoid meeting him .
A silence followed .
&quot; Even if your worst suppositions were correct , I don &apos;t - and never would - take on myself to judge either side , and I see no reason why our relations should be affected .
&quot; Run and find out what it is , &quot; she said , and with a calm sense of being prepared for anything , she sat down in a low chair , folding her hands on her knees .
But as she was dancing the last quadrille with one of the tiresome young men whom she could not refuse , she chanced to be _ vis @-@ à @-@ vis _ with Vronsky and Anna .
Her dress was not uncomfortable anywhere ; her lace berthe did not droop anywhere ; her rosettes were not crushed nor torn off ; her pink slippers with high , hollowed @-@ out heels did not pinch , but gladdened her feet ; and the thick rolls of fair chignon kept up on her head as if they were her own hair .
&quot; Get up ; you won &apos;t feel so excited . &quot; Vronsky looked round for the last time at his rivals .
Come , tell me what you &apos;re doing . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been living here for two years .
The crowd of friends and relations moved after them , with a buzz of talk and a rustle of skirts .
In the day nursery Seryozha , leaning on the table with his legs on a chair , was drawing and chatting away merrily .
You can &apos;t imagine what an effectual remedy it is for every sort of foolishness .
He was wearing a short coat , and his hands and big bones seemed huger than ever .
The third day Nikolay induced his brother to explain his plan to him again , and began not merely attacking it , but intentionally confounding it with communism .
You don &apos;t care that his whole life is ruined , that he is thuff ... thuff .... &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch was speaking so quickly that he stammered , and was utterly unable to articulate the word &quot; suffering . &quot; In the end he pronounced it &quot; thuffering . &quot; She wanted to laugh , and was immediately ashamed that anything could amuse her at such a moment .
The shutters were closed , there were few flies , and it was so clean that Levin was anxious that Laska , who had been running along the road and bathing in puddles , should not muddy the floor , and ordered her to a place in the corner by the door .
&quot; She &apos;s very sweet , isn &apos;t she ? &quot; said the countess of Madame Karenina .
I &apos;ll never go anywhere , especially not to Moscow . &quot; &quot; And what were you thinking about ? &quot; &quot; I ?
At Sergey Ivanovitch &apos;s little pills , everyone laughed ; Turovtsin in especial roared loudly and jovially , glad at last to have found something to laugh at , all he ever looked for in listening to conversation .
Petritsky , still humming , winked and made a pout with his lips , as though he would say : &quot; Oh , yes , we know your Bryansky . &quot; &quot; Mind you &apos;re not late ! &quot; was Yashvin &apos;s only comment ; and to change the conversation : &quot; How &apos;s my roan ?
Would you kindly explain for whose benefit you intend them ? &quot; &quot; For the widow , &quot; said Vronsky , shrugging his shoulders .
&quot; Your lover &apos;s letters , &quot; he said .
There are four days left now . &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch arranged this also , and Levin had to go to confession .
He had not slept the previous night , but was incapable of thinking of sleep either .
Having lost his antagonist , Levin continued the conversation with the gray @-@ whiskered landowner , trying to prove to him that all the difficulty arises from the fact that we don &apos;t find out the peculiarities and habits of our laborer ; but the landowner , like all men who think independently and in isolation , was slow in taking in any other person &apos;s idea , and particularly partial to his own .
Bowing to right and left to the people he met , and here as everywhere joyously greeting acquaintances , he went up to the sideboard for a preliminary appetizer of fish and vodka , and said to the painted Frenchwoman decked in ribbons , lace , and ringlets , behind the counter , something so amusing that even that Frenchwoman was moved to genuine laughter .
Myself or some other woman ? &quot; She was afraid of giving way to this delirium .
You know how I was married .
Oblonsky wrote to him from Petersburg : &quot; I have had a letter from Dolly ; she &apos;s at Ergushovo , and everything seems going wrong there .
His face turned red in patches , and his dim eyes looked straight before him .
&quot; Count the sands of the sea , number the stars .
He shook himself , and said in a shrill , loud voice : &quot; Forgive I cannot , and do not wish to , and I regard it as wrong .
They believe in the evil eye , and in witchcraft and omens , while we .... &quot; &quot; Oh , then you don &apos;t believe in it ? &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t believe in it , countess . &quot; &quot; But if I &apos;ve seen it myself ? &quot; &quot; The peasant women too tell us they have seen goblins . &quot; &quot; Then you think I tell a lie ? &quot; And she laughed a mirthless laugh .
Haven &apos;t I told you that I haven &apos;t a thought I wouldn &apos;t lay bare to you ? &quot; &quot; Yes , yes , &quot; she said , evidently trying to suppress her jealous thoughts .
That &apos;s how I look at it .
And this is said to me by my own sister , who imagines that ... that ... that she &apos;s sympathizing with me ! ...
It was awful to see her ! ...
He could not at this date repent of the fact that he , a handsome , susceptible man of thirty @-@ four , was not in love with his wife , the mother of five living and two dead children , and only a year younger than himself .
&quot; You had better lie down ; you &apos;d be easier , &quot; she said .
This is the answer he sent me . &quot; And Sergey Ivanovitch took a note from under a paper @-@ weight and handed it to his brother .
More than once she had told herself during the past few days , and again only a few moments before , that Vronsky was for her only one of the hundreds of young men , forever exactly the same , that are met everywhere , that she would never allow herself to bestow a thought upon him .
And he felt that this fact and what she expected of him called for something not fully defined in that code of principles by which he had hitherto steered his course in life .
He put his arms round her and pressed his lips to her mouth that sought his kiss .
Vronsky was longing now to hear to the end and know what Serpuhovskey would say to him .
Behind her stood the gloomy , healthy @-@ looking German workman who pushed the carriage .
&quot; I am not afraid of him ; I am afraid of death .
&quot; It appears , &quot; he went on , with eager interest , &quot; that Friedrich was not , after all , the person chiefly responsible for the partition of Poland .
&quot; If it is true that in the moment of agony and nearness to death she is genuinely penitent , and I , taking it for a trick , refuse to go ?
&quot; There ... in the outer room , &quot; answered the old man , bundling together the harness he had taken off , and flinging it on the ground .
On the day fixed he came and began the work .
Inside the church both lusters were already lighted , and all the candles before the holy pictures .
Tit made room , and Levin started behind him .
&quot; To sleep !
The day servant , not Yegor this time , brought it to him .
&quot; No , because he has treated me with contempt , &quot; said Kitty , in a breaking voice .
Only it &apos;s a pity I &apos;ve promised Betsy .
This second meeting might have been expected , one would have supposed , to estrange them still more .
He felt thrust out of the beaten track along which he had so proudly and lightly walked till then .
&quot; Whether he knows or not , &quot; said Vronsky , in his usual quiet and resolute tone , &quot; that &apos;s nothing to do with us .
Moreover , Stremov , one of the most influential people in Petersburg , and the elderly admirer of Liza Merkalova , was Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s enemy in the political world .
&quot; Do you remember that &apos;s what you used to call them ? &quot; He remembered absolutely nothing , but she had been laughing at the joke for ten years now , and was fond of it .
And , as he came out into the farmyard , Levin , like a tree in spring that knows not what form will be taken by the young shoots and twigs imprisoned in its swelling buds , hardly knew what undertakings he was going to begin upon now in the farm work that was so dear to him .
He sent for the carpenter , who , according to his orders , ought to have been at work at the thrashing machine .
He had been in Spain , and there had indulged in serenades and had made friends with a Spanish girl who played the mandolin .
_ Tiny bear _ has grown big now ! &quot; pursued the Frenchwoman , laughing , and she reminded him of his joke about the three young ladies whom he had compared to the three bears in the English nursery tale .
After his departure , he had to finish the daily routine of business with his secretary , and then he still had to drive round to call on a certain great personage on a matter of grave and serious import .
And again Grisha poked his little face under her arm , and nestled with his head on her gown , beaming with pride and happiness .
If he has a conscience , he &apos;ll work , and if not , there &apos;s no doing anything . &quot; &quot; Oh , come , you say yourself Ivan has begun looking after the cattle better . &quot; &quot; All I say is , &quot; answered Agafea Mihalovna , evidently not speaking at random , but in strict sequence of idea , &quot; that you ought to get married , that &apos;s what I say . &quot; Agafea Mihalovna &apos;s allusion to the very subject he had only just been thinking about , hurt and stung him .
This is the third time you &apos;ve asked me the same thing . &quot; The celebrated doctor did not take offense .
&quot; And now that bent , hollow chest ... and I , not knowing what will become of me , or wherefore .... &quot; &quot; K ... ha !
Agafea Mihalovna , seeing that it was coming to a quarrel , gently put down her cup and withdrew .
Then a good @-@ humored and rather pitiful smile showed itself on his handsome face .
&quot; Stiva , &quot; she said to him , winking gaily , crossing him and glancing towards the door , &quot; go , and God help you . &quot; He threw down the cigar , understanding her , and departed through the doorway .
Three times they were ranged ready to start , but each time some horse thrust itself out of line , and they had to begin again .
&quot; Oh , I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m not sleepy . &quot; &quot; I have had a good sleep , I &apos;m not in a sweat now .
All of this together was so extraordinarily nice that Levin laughed and cried with delight .
At that moment he knew only that Mahotin had flown swiftly by , while he stood staggering alone on the muddy , motionless ground , and Frou @-@ Frou lay gasping before him , bending her head back and gazing at him with her exquisite eyes .
&quot; Oh , no , only a few details , princess . &quot; &quot; Come this way . &quot; And the mother , accompanied by the doctor , went into the drawing @-@ room to Kitty .
He was in the most affectionate and good @-@ humored mood , just as Levin often remembered him in childhood .
He did not believe , he could not believe , that it was true .
&quot; Well then , come in , &quot; said Kitty , turning to Marya Nikolaevna , who had recovered herself , but noticing her husband &apos;s face of dismay , &quot; or go on ; go , and then come for me , &quot; she said , and went back into the room .
Thus , in spite of his solitude , or in consequence of his solitude , his life was exceedingly full .
The station @-@ master , too , ran by in his extraordinary colored cap .
&quot; I consent , count , and am ready to overlook it ; but you perceive that my wife - my wife &apos;s a respectable woman - has been exposed to the persecution , and insults , and effrontery of young upstarts , scoundrels .... &quot; And you must understand , the young upstarts are present all the while , and I have to keep the peace between them .
The other person was the doctor , who had also a kindly feeling for him ; but there had long existed a taciturn understanding between them that both were weighed down by work , and always in a hurry .
Dolly knew this trick her sister had of clenching her hands when she was much excited ; she knew , too , that in moments of excitement Kitty was capable of forgetting herself and saying a great deal too much , and Dolly would have soothed her , but it was too late .
All this she said brightly , rapidly , and with a peculiar brilliance in her eyes .
Her light , transparent skirts rose like a cloud about her slender waist ; one bare , thin , soft , girlish arm , hanging listlessly , was lost in the folds of her pink tunic ; in the other she held her fan , and with rapid , short strokes fanned her burning face .
He remembered every point , and did not think it necessary to go over in his memory what he would say .
Hitherto each individual desire , aroused by suffering or privation , such as hunger , fatigue , thirst , had been satisfied by some bodily function giving pleasure .
Besides , he got back again into the beaten track of his life .
He knew all the difficulties connected with this course , but he had said he would do it , and now he must carry out his threat .
Christ always has His definite embodiment in the art of the great masters .
Tell me , eh , is it possible ? &quot; she repeated , raising her voice , &quot; after my husband , the father of my children , enters into a love affair with his own children &apos;s governess ? &quot; &quot; But what could I do ?
But Marya Philimonovna had the happy thought of putting in gussets , and adding a little shoulder @-@ cape .
You &apos;ll hardly believe it , but till now I imagined that I was the only woman he had known .
I don &apos;t know how much love there is still in your heart for him .
The birches are not simply stuck in , but some are sown and some are planted , and one must deal carefully with them .
The sight of his brother , and the nearness of death , revived in Levin that sense of horror in face of the insoluble enigma , together with the nearness and inevitability of death , that had come upon him that autumn evening when his brother had come to him .
As he went on talking , his eyes glittered more and more angrily ; he was more and more hurried in his replies to imaginary opponents , and his face grew more and more excited and worried .
And on his own account he was anxious to enjoy to the utmost all Russian forms of amusement .
But I expect a strict observance of the external forms of propriety till such time &quot; - his voice shook - &quot; as I may take measures to secure my honor and communicate them to you . &quot; He got out first and helped her to get out .
We &apos;ve been talking all the way .
Of course I may be mistaken , but I fancy I have a certain capacity for the line I &apos;ve chosen , and that power of any sort in my hands , if it is to be , will be better than in the hands of a good many people I know , &quot; said Serpuhovskoy , with beaming consciousness of success ; &quot; and so the nearer I get to it , the better pleased I am . &quot; &quot; Perhaps that is true for you , but not for everyone .
&quot; Stop ! &quot; cried Petritsky to Vronsky as he was just going out .
A police officer , regardless of the frost , stood at the entrance , gorgeous in his uniform .
The footman brought Vronsky a note .
He did not know that his mode of behavior in relation to Kitty had a definite character , that it is courting young girls with no intention of marriage , and that such courting is one of the evil actions common among brilliant young men such as he was .
If you insist on a bill you shall pay me five roubles a month ; but it &apos;s really too bad of you . &quot; &quot; No , thank you .
Do you promise me ? ...
Merciful God !
But at that very instant both suddenly heard a shrill whistle which , as it were , smote on their ears , and both suddenly seized their guns and two flashes gleamed , and two bangs sounded at the very same instant .
Mind now . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re Flensburg , your excellency .
She tried to calm him , to calm herself , but it was too late .
But the nearer he came , the more excited she grew .
We make something immense out of love , but they are always _ terre @-@ à @-@ terre _ . &quot; &quot; Directly , directly ! &quot; he cried to a footman who came in .
But now , do this , come and see my wife . &quot; &quot; Well , we look at the matter differently , &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch coldly .
Why it was the three young ladies had one day to speak French , and the next English ; why it was that at certain hours they played by turns on the piano , the sounds of which were audible in their brother &apos;s room above , where the students used to work ; why they were visited by those professors of French literature , of music , of drawing , of dancing ; why at certain hours all the three young ladies , with Mademoiselle Linon , drove in the coach to the Tversky boulevard , dressed in their satin cloaks , Dolly in a long one , Natalia in a half @-@ long one , and Kitty in one so short that her shapely legs in tightly @-@ drawn red stockings were visible to all beholders ; why it was they had to walk about the Tversky boulevard escorted by a footman with a gold cockade in his hat - all this and much more that was done in their mysterious world he did not understand , but he was sure that everything that was done there was very good , and he was in love precisely with the mystery of the proceedings .
But I am not speaking of myself ; the most important persons in this matter are our son and yourself .
This servant , Yegor , whom Levin had noticed before , struck him as a very intelligent , excellent , and , above all , good @-@ hearted man .
Very nice , lighter .
Christ &apos;s foreshortened leg was not right , though .
&quot; Stremov and Liza Merkalova , why , they &apos;re the cream of the cream of society .
In spite of the terrible change in the face , Levin had only to glance at those eager eyes raised at his approach , only to catch the faint movement of the mouth under the sticky mustache , to realize the terrible truth that this death @-@ like body was his living brother .
&quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; he answered , not thinking of what he was saying .
&quot; I was very busy .
Seryozha screamed shrilly , as he often did , &quot; Ah , mamma ! &quot; and stopped , hesitating whether to go to greet his mother and put down the flowers , or to finish making the wreath and go with the flowers .
His thoughts , like his body , went round a complete circle , without coming upon anything new .
When all this was so firmly established , Kitty began to be very much bored , especially as the prince went away to Carlsbad and she was left alone with her mother .
Levin said good @-@ bye to them , but , not to be left alone , he attached himself to his brother .
A schoolfellow of Vronsky &apos;s and of the same age , he was a general and was expecting a command , which might have influence on the course of political events ; while Vronsky , independent and brilliant and beloved by a charming woman though he was , was simply a cavalry captain who was readily allowed to be as independent as ever he liked .
He was fond of talking about Shakespeare , Raphael , Beethoven , of the significance of new schools of poetry and music , all of which were classified by him with very conspicuous consistency .
&quot; Oh , yes , there &apos;s a very interesting article here , &quot; said Sviazhsky of the review Levin was holding in his hand .
She was even livelier than usual .
The feeling of triumph and radiant happiness flooded her soul more and more as the ceremony went on , and deprived her of all power of attention .
And , ashamed as he was of the feeling , he felt envious .
&quot; Oh , yes , that &apos;s just a sign that he has no need to do coarse work .
&quot; Besides , what is it to you - two days ?
Directly she thought of what her husband would do , the most terrible ideas came to her mind .
These two circumstances were : first , that on meeting Alexey Alexandrovitch the day before in the street he had noticed that he was cold and reserved with him , and putting the expression of Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s face and the fact that he had not come to see them or let them know of his arrival with the rumors he had heard about Anna and Vronsky , Stepan Arkadyevitch guessed that something was wrong between the husband and wife .
The chief source of income on his sister &apos;s estate was from the riverside meadows .
What is it you want of me ? &quot; &quot; I want you not to meet that man here , and to conduct yourself so that neither the world nor the servants can reproach you ... not to see him .
&quot; And his wife was there ....
He thought not of his wife , but of a complication that had arisen in his official life , which at the time constituted the chief interest of it .
Anna was hurt .
In Petersburg Vronsky intended to arrange a partition of the land with his brother , while Anna meant to see her son .
A high , narrow carriage with a pair of grays was standing at the entrance .
She was rejoicing over Kitty and Levin ; going back in thought to her own wedding , she glanced at the radiant figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch , forgot all the present , and remembered only her own innocent love .
&quot; No , I won &apos;t take her , &quot; she decided .
He was irrationally jealous over his daughters , especially over Kitty , who was his favorite .
Levin said hush to her , and looked round at the sick man .
You can &apos;t see your own position as I can .
She was more splendid than he had imagined her .
I see no distinct grounds for classical studies being given a preeminence over scientific studies . &quot; &quot; The natural sciences have just as great an educational value , &quot; put in Pestsov .
Sympathy and love unfeigned were visible on Anna &apos;s face .
I speak plainly , at my age , and I tell you simply that I &apos;ve lost my heart to you . &quot; Stereotyped as the phrase was , Madame Karenina obviously believed it and was delighted by it .
Better not tell ; why put him to the proof ? &quot; she thought , still staring at him in the same way , and feeling the hand that held the leaf was trembling more and more .
&quot; And I , by agreeing to an unlawful divorce , shall be to blame for her ruin . &quot; He had thought it all over hundreds of times , and was convinced that a divorce was not at all simple , as Stepan Arkadyevitch had said , but was utterly impossible .
He felt sorry for her , and he felt he could not help her , and with that he knew that he was to blame for her wretchedness , and that he had done something wrong .
This was very annoying to Levin .
&quot; You &apos;d better tell me what to drink ; such a nasty taste in my mouth , that .... &quot; &quot; Brandy &apos;s better than anything , &quot; boomed Yashvin .
Her lips trembled so that for a long while she could say nothing .
Behind Levin came the lad Mishka .
&quot; Dolly ! &quot; he said in a subdued and timid voice .
Why , that &apos;s just what I came for !
How could they fail to see how they were ruining themselves , lowering their _ prestige _ by this appointment ?
Stepan Arkadyevitch , with his sister on his arm , turned back .
Linon , have you ? &quot; &quot; Not yet . &quot; &quot; Go and speak to her , she likes you so much . &quot; &quot; What &apos;s wrong ?
&quot; But the point is that I won &apos;t abandon Anna to your mercies .
That may always happen . &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed heavily and closed his eyes .
&quot; Why , hasn &apos;t he gone into the country yet - to see about selling that forest ? &quot; &quot; No , he &apos;s still getting ready for the journey . &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s it ! &quot; said the prince .
&quot; When are you going ? &quot; she said .
In the glance , in which their eyes met in the looking @-@ glass , it was clear that they understood one another .
Till two o &apos;clock the sitting would go on without a break , and at two o &apos;clock there would be an interval and luncheon .
Then he withdrew , leaving in Alexey Alexandrovitch an unpleasant sense that something was wrong with him , and that there was no chance of curing it .
Quite without attracting notice , without glancing at them , as though there were no other places left , Stepan Arkadyevitch put Levin and Kitty side by side .
&quot; My position is so awful because I can find nowhere , I cannot find within me strength to support me . &quot; &quot; You will find support ; seek it - not in me , though I beseech you to believe in my friendship , &quot; she said , with a sigh .
&quot; I remember , and I know that blue haze like the mist on the mountains in Switzerland .
&quot; Oh , there &apos;s so much that &apos;s important , &quot; said Varenka , smiling .
And indeed , no sooner had he uttered these words , when all at once , like the sun going behind a cloud , her face lost all its friendliness , and Levin detected the familiar change in her expression that denoted the working of thought ; a crease showed on her smooth brow .
He felt that Yashvin , in spite of his apparent contempt for every sort of feeling , was the only man who could , so he fancied , comprehend the intense passion which now filled his whole life .
They deny the justice of property , of capital , of inheritance , while I do not deny this chief stimulus . &quot; ( Levin felt disgusted himself at using such expressions , but ever since he had been engrossed by his work , he had unconsciously come more and more frequently to use words not Russian . )
&quot; Good @-@ bye , Darya Alexandrovna , till we meet again . &quot; &quot; No , wait a minute , &quot; she said , clutching him by the sleeve .
And it serves me right ! &quot; Kitty cried quickly , snatching the parasol out of Varenka &apos;s hand , and looking past her friend &apos;s face .
Levin made no answer this time , not because he did not want to enter upon a discussion with the priest , but because , so far , no one had ever asked him such questions , and when his babes did ask him those questions , it would be time enough to think about answering them .
They were not only fond of Vronsky in his regiment , they respected him too , and were proud of him ; proud that this man , with his immense wealth , his brilliant education and abilities , and the path open before him to every kind of success , distinction , and ambition , had disregarded all that , and of all the interests of life had the interests of his regiment and his comrades nearest to his heart .
Her Moscow troubles had become a memory to her .
&quot; I feel as if , coming to you , I had landed on a peaceful shore after the noise and jolting of a steamer .
Again she struggled all over like a fish , and her shoulders setting the saddle heaving , she rose on her front legs but unable to lift her back , she quivered all over and again fell on her side .
Kouzma , who already scented a big tip , never left Stepan Arkadyevitch &apos;s side , and put on him both his stockings and boots , a task which Stepan Arkadyevitch readily left him .
&quot; You know what for , &quot; he answered boldly and joyfully , meeting her glance and not dropping his eyes .
Sergey Ivanovitch met his brother with the smile of chilly friendliness he always had for everyone , and introducing him to the professor , went on with the conversation .
&quot; Here one would think that to get out of all the baseness and the mess , one &apos;s own and other people &apos;s , would be a good thing , and yet I &apos;m afraid of death , awfully afraid of death . &quot; He shuddered .
&quot; You did not expect to find me like this , &quot; he articulated with effort .
A beardless youth , one of those society youths whom the old Prince Shtcherbatsky called &quot; young bucks , &quot; in an exceedingly open waistcoat , straightening his white tie as he went , bowed to them , and after running by , came back to ask Kitty for a quadrille .
I am entirely in your power , only let me be here ... though I am at your disposal .
&quot; There was a time when you thought of breaking off ....
Varenka made - simply and naturally as she did everything - a movement between a bow and a curtsey , and immediately began talking to the prince , without shyness , naturally , as she talked to everyone .
And now she &apos;s aware that the lack of comprehension suits her .
&quot; How is it Anna Pavlovna &apos;s not been to see us for so long ? &quot; the princess said one day of Madame Petrova .
&quot; Why , what is there shameful ? &quot; she said .
He was born in the midst of those who had been and are the powerful ones of this world .
&quot; All consolation and counsel and Christian forgiveness , all that I have thought over a thousand times , and it &apos;s all no use . &quot; All these days Dolly had been alone with her children .
Though she had sent word the day before to her husband that it was nothing to her whether his sister came or not , she had made everything ready for her arrival , and was expecting her sister @-@ in @-@ law with emotion .
&quot; Well , show the person up at once , &quot; said Oblonsky , frowning with vexation .
Altogether their honeymoon - that is to say , the month after their wedding - from which from tradition Levin expected so much , was not merely not a time of sweetness , but remained in the memories of both as the bitterest and most humiliating period in their lives .
The Grand Duchess positively wanted to show the new helmet to the ambassador .
The door opened , and the hall @-@ porter with a rug on his arm called the carriage .
This boy was more often than anyone else a check upon their freedom .
He got up and pulled up the window .
You didn &apos;t count them , but Ryabinin did .
&quot; Mercy !
Soon .
The priest was continually sending first the beadle and then the deacon to find out whether the bridegroom had not come , more and more often he went himself , in a lilac vestment and an embroidered sash , to the side door , expecting to see the bridegroom .
The two sisters brought all the six children successfully through it , but Kitty was no better in health , and in Lent the Shtcherbatskys went abroad .
He went in together with Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev and Pestsov , who had reached the street door at the same moment .
Going towards the stable , he met the white @-@ legged chestnut , Mahotin &apos;s Gladiator , being led to the race @-@ course in a blue forage horsecloth , with what looked like huge ears edged with blue .
She turned her head , and with a smile said : &quot; Good @-@ bye till this evening . &quot; At that moment Stepan Arkadyevitch , his hat cocked on one side , with beaming face and eyes , strode into the garden like a conquering hero .
She had too great a desire to live herself .
I have offended her .
&quot; Oh , here are your three horses , &quot; he added , seeing the carriage drive up .
In the trap sat the chubby , tightly belted clerk who served Ryabinin as coachman .
You must understand that I was so far from suspecting infidelity , I regarded it as impossible , and then - try to imagine it - with such ideas , to find out suddenly all the horror , all the loathsomeness .... You must try and understand me .
&quot; Oh , nothing ; there &apos;s not much happiness in life . &quot; &quot; Not much ?
In old days to go anywhere in a ball dress was a simple joy to me , I admired myself ; now I feel ashamed and awkward .
Then they did the same to the colonel .
And in almost all the figures and faces he saw , too , remnants of the wrappings not perfectly removed that spoiled the picture .
&quot; Nothing , I need nothing , &quot; she said to Annushka , who was rearranging the bottles and brushes on the dressing table .
They ought to be persuaded .... Well , let them go then . &quot; He glanced once more at his watch .
It &apos;s not unhappiness , or low spirits , but much worse .
Your too animated conversation this evening with Count Vronsky &quot; ( he enunciated the name firmly and with deliberate emphasis ) &quot; attracted attention . &quot; He talked and looked at her laughing eyes , which frightened him now with their impenetrable look , and , as he talked , he felt all the uselessness and idleness of his words .
And neither of them gave an answer , or even a hint , in reply to the question what he , Levin , and all the Russian peasants and landowners , were to do with their millions of hands and millions of acres , to make them as productive as possible for the common weal .
Levin expected something of peculiar gravity and importance from the expression of his face , but Nikolay began speaking of his health .
After the irritating discussion with his brother , he pondered over this intention again .
And , disagreeable as it was to the princess to seem to take the first step in wishing to make the acquaintance of Madame Stahl , who thought fit to give herself airs , she made inquiries about Varenka , and , having ascertained particulars about her tending to prove that there could be no harm though little good in the acquaintance , she herself approached Varenka and made acquaintance with her .
And Levin saw that the organization of all these details was by no means so easy as he had fancied before .
It was the first winter that she had been out in the world .
Vronsky had put his name down , bought a thoroughbred English mare , and in spite of his love affair , he was looking forward to the races with intense , though reserved , excitement ....
Nothing .
Only in the last extremity shall I apply to you . &quot; And she got up and went out .
&quot; You say , &quot; she said , pursuing the subject that had been started , &quot; that my husband cannot be interested in what &apos;s Russian .
Her presentiment that all would again go on in the old way had not deceived her .
Everyone wished for nothing but that he should die as soon as possible , and everyone , concealing this , gave him medicines , tried to find remedies and doctors , and deceived him and themselves and each other .
I &apos;m an old friend . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re home after a journey , &quot; said the baroness , &quot; so I &apos;m flying .
The education of women , for instance , would naturally be regarded as likely to be harmful , but the government opens schools and universities for women . &quot; And the conversation at once passed to the new subject of the education of women .
But after she had gone to bed , for a long while she could not sleep .
I don &apos;t understand it , but it is so . &quot; &quot; Yes , but he has kissed her .... &quot; &quot; Dolly , hush , darling .
&quot; Why , good heavens , it &apos;s four already , and I &apos;ve still to go to Dolgovushin &apos;s !
I mean to get married , &quot; and how Nikolay had promptly answered , as of a matter on which there could be no possible doubt : &quot; And high time too , Konstantin Dmitrievitch . &quot; But marriage had now become further off than ever .
Catching sight of her , he came to meet her , his lips falling into their habitual sarcastic smile , and his big , tired eyes looking straight at her .
The conversation fell upon table @-@ turning and spirits , and Countess Nordston , who believed in spiritualism , began to describe the marvels she had seen .
&quot; Why , he &apos;s dying - yes , he &apos;ll die in the spring , and how help him ?
To speak of it to my husband would be unnecessary and out of the question .
It was a very agreeable conversation .
But instead of that she let her eyes rest on him , full of love , and made no answer .
You know in decent society one doesn &apos;t talk or think even of certain details of the toilet .
Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s success had been even greater than he had anticipated .
If decent people won &apos;t go into it , of course it &apos;s bound to go all wrong .
That tall gentleman was abusing the doctor , flinging all sorts of insults at him because he wasn &apos;t treating him quite as he liked , and he began waving his stick at him .
But in the corridor there was no sign of the person he was looking for and he came back in despair , and frantically waving his hands addressed Stepan Arkadyevitch , who was smoking serenely .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid not , &quot; answered Marya Nikolaevna .
You see that , you see that ! &quot; Nikolay shouted joyfully .
He &apos;s happy and contented . &quot; &quot; Oh , no ! &quot; Anna interposed quickly .
Now it is settled . &quot; He added : &quot; Settled that you &apos;ll take me whatever I may be - you won &apos;t give me up ?
Kitty admired her more than ever , and more and more acute was her suffering .
Pray to God , beseech Him .
I can &apos;t , I can &apos;t live with him .
&quot; But wait a little !
And all this seemed to him so easy a conquest over himself that he spent the whole drive in the pleasantest daydreams .
Kitty , on the contrary , was more active than usual .
With friends , one is well ; but at home , one is better , &quot; he answered , and went into his study .
No , I ! &quot; screamed the children , who had finished tea , running up to their Aunt Anna .
Stepan Arkadyevitch made an effort and struggled with the timidity that had come over him .
&quot; I have nothing to make me miserable , &quot; she said , getting calmer ; &quot; but can you understand that everything has become hateful , loathsome , coarse to me , and I myself most of all ?
It was one of Kitty &apos;s best days .
The sick man kept his brother &apos;s hand in his own .
&quot; Come , master , taste my sop , &quot; said he , kneeling down before the cup .
And immediately this glance established a living relationship between living men .
The princess saw that in the evenings Kitty read a French testament that Madame Stahl had given her - a thing she had never done before ; that she avoided society acquaintances and associated with the sick people who were under Varenka &apos;s protection , and especially one poor family , that of a sick painter , Petrov .
First of all , you &apos;re trying to catch an eligible gentleman , and all Moscow will be talking of it , and with good reason .
His mother pulled the button off and put it in her pocket .
If you must have the satisfaction of animal passion .... &quot; &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch !
&quot; You guess ? &quot; responded Levin , his eyes like deep wells of light fixed on Stepan Arkadyevitch .
This renunciation gave him satisfaction , and was easy and simple .
To be fully convinced of one &apos;s happiness , and all at once .... &quot; continued Dolly , holding back her sobs , &quot; to get a letter ... his letter to his mistress , my governess .
He was dressed in a long @-@ skirted blue coat , with buttons below the waist at the back , and wore high boots wrinkled over the ankles and straight over the calf , with big galoshes drawn over them .
She saw , too , how coldly her father responded at last to Vronsky &apos;s bow , and how Vronsky looked with amiable perplexity at her father , as though trying and failing to understand how and why anyone could be hostilely disposed towards him , and she flushed .
On entering the drawing @-@ room Stepan Arkadyevitch apologized , explaining that he had been detained by that prince , who was always the scapegoat for all his absences and unpunctualities , and in one moment he had made all the guests acquainted with each other , and , bringing together Alexey Alexandrovitch and Sergey Koznishev , started them on a discussion of the Russification of Poland , into which they immediately plunged with Pestsov .
Oh , I &apos;ll be off this minute , if I &apos;m in the way . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re home , wherever you are , baroness , &quot; said Vronsky .
&quot; Up comes the Grand Duchess with some ambassador or other , and , as ill @-@ luck would have it , she begins talking to him about the new helmets .
I &apos;ve not long ... yesterday ...
He considered the Russian peasant as occupying a stage of development intermediate between the ape and the man , and at the same time in the local assemblies no one was readier to shake hands with the peasants and listen to their opinion .
He started so that he leaped up on the springs of the sofa , and leaning on his arms got in a panic onto his knees .
We &apos;ll look sharp !
This was so simply said , and so sweet was the truthful and candid expression of her face , that the princess saw why Kitty had taken such a fancy to Varenka .
What does it mean ? &quot; Betsy smiled with her eyes , and looked intently at Anna .
He did not sleep the whole night , and his fury , growing in a sort of vast , arithmetical progression , reached its highest limits in the morning .
No , thank you . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t agree that it &apos;s necessary or possible to raise the level of agriculture still higher , &quot; said Levin .
Everyone laughed , and Stepan Arkadyevitch with particular good humor .
Tit kept moving on , without stopping , not showing the slightest weariness , but Levin was already beginning to be afraid he would not be able to keep it up : he was so tired .
The world &apos;s made so , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch .
What is there I care for ? &quot; Again she felt that her soul was beginning to be split in two .
And this mortified him and hurt his feelings .
&quot; Come , come , as we were sitting before , &quot; said Anna Arkadyevna , sitting down in her place .
The sun was setting behind a thick forest , and in the glow of sunset the birch trees , dotted about in the aspen copse , stood out clearly with their hanging twigs , and their buds swollen almost to bursting .
I told you at the time that .... &quot; He yawned inwardly , without opening his mouth .
And with him one can &apos;t be ill at ease .
It &apos;s dreadful , but I do love to see his face , and I do love this fantastic light .... My husband !
&quot; Whom are you attacking ?
I &apos;m not strong enough .
And all of a sudden , instead of his life with his wife being made on an individual pattern , it was , on the contrary , entirely made up of the pettiest details , which he had so despised before , but which now , by no will of his own , had gained an extraordinary importance that it was useless to contend against .
&quot; And I confess , &quot; he said , with a smile , showing his thick , white teeth , &quot; this week I &apos;ve been , as it were , looking at myself in a glass , seeing that life , and I didn &apos;t like it . &quot; She held the work in her hands , but did not crochet , and looked at him with strange , shining , and hostile eyes .
The cowherd girls , picking up their petticoats , ran splashing through the mud with bare legs , still white , not yet brown from the sun , waving brush wood in their hands , chasing the calves that frolicked in the mirth of spring .
He did not care about that now .
Now these pursuits were necessary for him that life might not be too uniformly bright .
&quot; I have left this question to you to decide , and I am very glad to see .... &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch was beginning .
&quot; Whom do you want ? &quot; said the voice of Nikolay Levin , angrily .
The palazzo suddenly seemed so obtrusively old and dirty , the spots on the curtains , the cracks in the floors , the broken plaster on the cornices became so disagreeably obvious , and the everlasting sameness of Golenishtchev , and the Italian professor and the German traveler became so wearisome , that they had to make some change .
I liked you simply , but you most likely only wanted to save me , to improve me . &quot; &quot; You are unjust , &quot; said Varenka .
He puts me in the position of playing false , which I never meant and never mean to do . &quot; Vronsky &apos;s ideas had changed since the day of his conversation with Anna in the Vrede garden .
What &apos;s the meaning of that ?
But the princess disliked this exaggeration , and disliked even more the fact that she felt her daughter did not care to show her all her heart .
I can &apos;t tell , I don &apos;t know anything about it . &quot; &quot; Yes , but let .... &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t understand .
The successful figure he had already forgotten .
Anna went into the drawing @-@ room to receive these guests .
That bill on blue paper , for a hat and ribbons , he could not recall without a rush of self @-@ pity .
And one can but sympathize with this desire to assist in the general labor of man . &quot; &quot; Quite so , &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch assented .
I have worked for him , and all I had has gone in his service , and now of course any fresh , vulgar creature has more charm for him .
But on the other hand Varenka , alone in the world , without friends or relations , with a melancholy disappointment in the past , desiring nothing , regretting nothing , was just that perfection of which Kitty dared hardly dream .
The porter said that the man had only just gone out .
&quot; I did not expect ... thee . &quot; &quot; Mercy !
With him there was a well @-@ known professor of philosophy , who had come from Harkov expressly to clear up a difference that had arisen between them on a very important philosophical question .
&quot; This is what I meant to say to you , &quot; he went on coldly and composedly , &quot; and I beg you to listen to it .
But yet inevitably the Shtcherbatskys were thrown most into the society of a Moscow lady , Marya Yevgenyevna Rtishtcheva and her daughter , whom Kitty disliked , because she had fallen ill , like herself , over a love affair , and a Moscow colonel , whom Kitty had known from childhood , and always seen in uniform and epaulets , and who now , with his little eyes and his open neck and flowered cravat , was uncommonly ridiculous and tedious , because there was no getting rid of him .
But if he were a prince of the blood , my daughter need not run after anyone . &quot; &quot; But what have I done ? &quot; &quot; Why , you &apos;ve .... &quot; The prince was crying wrathfully .
I must own I can &apos;t make it out .
It &apos;s a law . &quot; &quot; Then we &apos;re outside the law ; rent explains nothing for us , but simply muddles us .
Altogether everything was supremely amusing and jolly .
&quot; The only ones ? &quot; Serpuhovskoy queried , smiling .
Nothing special happened .
As usual , too , his wife had moved for the summer to a villa out of town , while he remained in Petersburg .
For some time , is it ?
Who wants to play croquet ? &quot; &quot; Oh , I like it , &quot; said Anna .
&quot; Thank you , &quot; said the old man , and he took the glass , but refused sugar , pointing to a lump he had left .
He laughed a cold and malignant laugh .
So one goes on living , amusing oneself with hunting , with work - anything so as not to think of death ! &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled a subtle affectionate smile as he listened to Levin .
When he got into the academy and made his reputation he tried , as he &apos;s no fool , to educate himself .
I &apos;m very , very glad ! &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s go in .
Vronsky , though he did not usually notice details , noticed at this moment the amazed expression with which the porter glanced at him .
&quot; But .... &quot; The family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his observations .
Yes , it was awful , but it was so .
But he had never dreamed of what Stepan Arkadyevitch replied .
There were crack skaters there , showing off their skill , and learners clinging to chairs with timid , awkward movements , boys , and elderly people skating with hygienic motives .
It &apos;s difficult .
&quot; No , thank you ! &quot; &quot; Where shall I take you ? &quot; &quot; Madame Karenina &apos;s here , I think ... take me to her . &quot; &quot; Wherever you command . &quot; And Korsunsky began waltzing with measured steps straight towards the group in the left corner , continually saying , &quot; Pardon , mesdames , pardon , pardon , mesdames &quot; ; and steering his course through the sea of lace , tulle , and ribbon , and not disarranging a feather , he turned his partner sharply round , so that her slim ankles , in light transparent stockings , were exposed to view , and her train floated out in fan shape and covered Krivin &apos;s knees .
What nonsense ! &quot; &quot; But we won &apos;t talk about it .
Our way &apos;s to wait till St. Peter &apos;s Day .
A hawklike , greedy , cruel expression was left upon it .
&quot; There &apos;s some sense in this custom of saying good @-@ bye to bachelor life , &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch .
I don &apos;t blame you , and God is my witness that on seeing you at the time of your illness I resolved with my whole heart to forget all that had passed between us and to begin a new life .
She showed that alertness , that swiftness of reflection which comes out in men before a battle , in conflict , in the dangerous and decisive moments of life - those moments when a man shows once and for all his value , and that all his past has not been wasted but has been a preparation for these moments .
&quot; No , it can &apos;t be , it oughtn &apos;t to be !
I &apos;m ambitious ; that &apos;s my weakness , and I confess to it . &quot; &quot; Perhaps you wouldn &apos;t confess to it if you hadn &apos;t been successful , &quot; said Vronsky .
And irrepressible delight and eagerness shone in her face .
But the point is that art cannot suffer doubt and discussion .
I could kill him . &quot; &quot; Darling Dolly , I understand , but don &apos;t torture yourself .
But I &apos;m glad , very glad .
it &apos;s not honest .
Levin lost all sense of time , and could not have told whether it was late or early now .
Three ladies - an old lady , a young lady , and a merchant &apos;s wife - and three gentlemen - one a German banker with a ring on his finger , the second a merchant with a beard , and the third a wrathful @-@ looking government clerk in official uniform , with a cross on his neck - had obviously been waiting a long while already .
When he told me , I will own I did not realize all the awfulness of your position .
They regret it deeply , and beg you to overlook their misbehavior . &quot; The government clerk was softened once more .
&quot; I &apos;ve got it , Stiva ! &quot; he shouted .
Vronsky meant that after the duel - inevitable , he thought - things could not go on as before , but he said something different .
And on reaching the stream the mowers moved off across the lines of cut grass towards their pile of coats , where the children who had brought their dinners were sitting waiting for them .
Because he , dear fellow , loved her , was in love with her .
&quot; Nikolay Dmitrievitch will be delighted .
Stepan Arkadyevitch was telling his sister @-@ in @-@ law his joke about divorce .
Anna saved me .
It seemed to him sweet , but strange , and he thought it would have been better without this .
Indeed , it was such a lovely day that one could not be angry .
&quot; Come , really , &quot; said Oblonsky in surprise .
Levin felt himself to blame , and could not set things right .
I never appeal to him , and never shall appeal to him .
After supper , the same night , the young people left for the country .
&quot; Yes , of course .
Never had Levin been so glad when the evening was over and it was time to go to bed .
But Stremov , who had felt stung to the quick at the last sitting , had , on the reception of the commission &apos;s report , resorted to tactics which Alexey Alexandrovitch had not anticipated .
&quot; If you come near me , I will call in the servants , the children !
Marya !
No , no , we are busy at our work ! &quot; Work did not progress further , and they darted apart from one another like culprits when Kouzma came in to announce that tea was ready .
As he saw all this , there came over him for an instant a doubt of the possibility of arranging the new life , of which he had been dreaming on the road .
We &apos;ll all have a drink . &quot; &quot; No ; good @-@ bye all of you .
&quot; Well !
I understand what that means .
Even if we remain in the same house , we are strangers - strangers forever ! &quot; She repeated again with special significance the word so dreadful to her .
They both alike tried in later life to blot out from their memories all the monstrous , shameful incidents of that morbid period , when both were rarely in a normal frame of mind , both were rarely quite themselves .
That is he , &quot; said the doorkeeper , pointing to a strongly built , broad @-@ shouldered man with a curly beard , who , without taking off his sheepskin cap , was running lightly and rapidly up the worn steps of the stone staircase .
He examined that face again , trying not to read what was so plainly written on it , and against his own will , with horror read on it what he did not want to know .
&quot; Mamma meant to go and see the Petrovs .
&quot; Well , and how did it end ? &quot; &quot; Luckily at that point that ... the one in the mushroom hat ... intervened .
But it was not that Levin was not in good spirits ; he was ill at ease .
It was the chasm which he was afraid to peep into .
Golenishtchev &apos;s faith in Vronsky &apos;s talent was propped up by his own need of Vronsky &apos;s sympathy and approval for his own articles and ideas , and he felt that the praise and support must be mutual .
He recognized all his magnanimity , but he did not now feel himself humiliated by it .
But where &apos;s the supper ?
He urged on his mare , and to his delight felt that she easily quickened her pace , and the thud of Gladiator &apos;s hoofs was again heard at the same distance away .
Have anything to eat or drink ? &quot; asked Yashvin .
&quot; That &apos;s to say , you think there &apos;s a lack of something in me ? &quot; &quot; Perhaps so , &quot; said Levin .
&quot; Ah , countess , you really must take me , for pity &apos;s sake do take me to see them !
The prince went up to her , and Kitty detected that disconcerting gleam of irony in his eyes .
This is what I wanted to say .
Sport has , in my opinion , a great value , and as is always the case , we see nothing but what is most superficial . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not superficial , &quot; said Princess Tverskaya .
Here , would you care ? ... &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got them at last ? &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , laying his finger on the paper .
She merely thought that she had to go to see Madame Berthe too that evening , and to make haste home in time for _ maman &apos;s _ tea at twelve o &apos;clock .
But there was now no time for wonder .
Whether we shall be the happiest or the wretchedest of people - that &apos;s in your hands . &quot; She would have said something , but he interrupted her .
Dolly !
And so in spite of the friendliness and directness of their relations , Konstantin felt an awkwardness in leaving him alone .
&quot; I can &apos;t see where philosophy comes in , &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch , in a tone , Levin fancied , as though he did not admit his brother &apos;s right to talk about philosophy .
&quot; Why , but I told you during Lent to put in pipes , &quot; he cried .
&quot; Vronsky is one of the sons of Count Kirill Ivanovitch Vronsky , and one of the finest specimens of the gilded youth of Petersburg .
And there a merchant will get three acres of land , worth ten roubles , as security for the loan of one rouble .
Instinctively feeling the approach of spring , and knowing that there would be days of rough weather too , she built her nest as best she could , and was in haste at the same time to build it and to learn how to do it .
After a fearful agony and a sense of something huge , bigger than the head itself , being torn out of his jaw , the sufferer , hardly able to believe in his own good luck , feels all at once that what has so long poisoned his existence and enchained his attention , exists no longer , and that he can live and think again , and take interest in other things besides his tooth .
&quot; He is gone , &quot; said the priest , and would have moved away ; but suddenly there was a faint stir in the mustaches of the dead man that seemed glued together , and quite distinctly in the hush they heard from the bottom of the chest the sharply defined sounds : &quot; Not quite ... soon . &quot; And a minute later the face brightened , a smile came out under the mustaches , and the women who had gathered round began carefully laying out the corpse .
&quot; Yes , it &apos;s all over , but it was all much less serious than we had supposed , &quot; answered Anna .
In both groups conversation wavered , as it always does , for the first few minutes , broken up by meetings , greetings , offers of tea , and as it were , feeling about for something to rest upon .
But how girls were to be married , and how parents were to marry them , no one knew .
&quot; So long as we live , it must be so .
But in making these corrections he was not altering the figure but simply getting rid of what concealed the figure .
They naïvely believed that it was their business to lay before the commission their needs and the actual condition of things , and to ask assistance of the government , and utterly failed to grasp that some of their statements and requests supported the contention of the enemy &apos;s side , and so spoiled the whole business .
&quot; There isn &apos;t a girl who hasn &apos;t been through the same .
He said , addressing God , &quot; If Thou dost exist , make this man to recover &quot; ( of course this same thing has been repeated many times ) , &quot; and Thou wilt save him and me . &quot; After extreme unction the sick man became suddenly much better .
There &apos;s no getting at the real daughter .
&quot; What &apos;s this ?
Alexey Alexandrovitch said something which Dolly could not catch in the noise of the moving carriages .
&quot; Well , come along , I &apos;ll take you to your room , &quot; she went on , trying to defer as long as possible the moment of confidences .
&quot; Can they have finished ploughing ? &quot; he wondered .
Levin scarcely remembered his mother .
And just as the hungry stomach eagerly accepts every object it can get , hoping to find nourishment in it , Vronsky quite unconsciously clutched first at politics , then at new books , and then at pictures .
Levin went to the house of the Shtcherbatskys .
In the evening at tea , two landowners who had come about some business connected with a wardship were of the party , and the interesting conversation Levin had been looking forward to sprang up .
When they came out of the woods , all his attention was engrossed by the view of the fallow land on the upland , in parts yellow with grass , in parts trampled and checkered with furrows , in parts dotted with ridges of dung , and in parts even ploughed .
Now he was glad to get away from the neighborhood of the Shtcherbatskys , and still more from his farm work , especially on a shooting expedition , which always in trouble served as the best consolation .
In the courtyard the first objects that met Vronsky &apos;s eyes were a band of singers in white linen coats , standing near a barrel of vodka , and the robust , good @-@ humored figure of the colonel surrounded by officers .
Oh , that &apos;s a new type , quite new . &quot; Betsy said all this , and , at the same time , from her good @-@ humored , shrewd glance , Anna felt that she partly guessed her plight , and was hatching something for her benefit .
And it must be settled . &quot; &quot; What did you go away for ? &quot; &quot; Ah , stop a minute !
But a sense of his regarding all aid as out of the question was felt by the sick man , and exasperated him .
Laska kept poking her head under his hand .
Levin , on hearing this , informed Yegor that , in his opinion , in marriage the great thing was love , and that with love one would always be happy , for happiness rests only on oneself .
He was a believer , who was interested in religion primarily in its political aspect , and the new doctrine which ventured upon several new interpretations , just because it paved the way to discussion and analysis , was in principle disagreeable to him .
She was one of those creatures which seem only not to speak because the mechanism of their mouth does not allow them to .
&quot; Yes , &quot; answered Varenka .
She had sent a manservant and a maid out to look for him .
But now they beamed and exclaimed with delight on recognizing one another .
Alexey Alexandrovitch went into the bedroom , and went up to the bed .
His excellency &apos;s asking too much for the forest .
When Konstantin took him by the hand , Nikolay smiled .
You &apos;ll come back for some tea ; that &apos;s delightful ! &quot; she said , and went out , gay and radiant .
For one instant of this happiness .... &quot; &quot; Happiness ! &quot; she said with horror and loathing and her horror unconsciously infected him .
Vronsky at the first moment felt embarrassed at not even knowing of the first part of the _ Two Elements _ , of which the author spoke as something well known .
Practical affairs are not my strong point .
&quot; Blessed be the name of the Lord , &quot; the solemn syllables rang out slowly one after another , setting the air quivering with waves of sound .
He went up to Madame Stahl , and addressed her with extreme courtesy and affability in that excellent French that so few speak nowadays .
And all equally felt this strange and painful for the first minute .
&quot; As regards myself , I have no fear of your doing so ; he will not make you quarrel with me ; but for your own sake , I should say you would do better not to go .
He had had his last interview with her at his cousin Betsy &apos;s summer villa .
&quot; In the same way I didn &apos;t want to leave Petersburg , and now I don &apos;t want to go away from here . &quot; &quot; You came here and did a good deed , &quot; said Dolly , looking intently at her .
&quot; Wonderfully good @-@ hearted fellow ! &quot; thought Levin .
But in spite of this , each of them - as is often the way with men who have selected careers of different kinds - though in discussion he would even justify the other &apos;s career , in his heart despised it .
&quot; One must get out of the humiliating position in which one is placed ; one can &apos;t live _ à trois _ . &quot; &quot; I understand , I quite understand that , &quot; said Dolly , and her head sank .
In the letter he enclosed three of Vronsky &apos;s notes to Anna , which were in the portfolio he had taken away .
Of pluck - that is , energy and courage - Vronsky did not merely feel that he had enough ; what was of far more importance , he was firmly convinced that no one in the world could have more of this &quot; pluck &quot; than he had .
Gradually , as he rode towards the meadow , the peasants came into sight , some in coats , some in their shirts mowing , one behind another in a long string , swinging their scythes differently .
&quot; No , &quot; she said to herself , &quot; there &apos;s no need of anything , &quot; and tearing up the letter , she wrote it again , leaving out the allusion to generosity , and sealed it up .
After signing the papers brought him , Alexey Alexandrovitch had sat for a long while in silence , glancing at Mihail Vassilievitch , and several times he attempted to speak , but could not .
But he climbed up and did what he had to do .
But specialized trials of skill are a sign of development . &quot; &quot; No , I shan &apos;t come another time ; it &apos;s too upsetting , &quot; said Princess Betsy .
&quot; My God !
Let &apos;s sit here . &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch , with the same expression of indifference , given him by his lifted eyebrows , sat down beside Darya Alexandrovna , and smiled affectedly .
Oblonsky did dine at home : the conversation was general , and his wife , speaking to him , addressed him as &quot; Stiva , &quot; as she had not done before .
We lunched together , and I taught him how to make , you know that drink , wine and oranges .
&quot; I should ask you to come to us , you know , but my wife &apos;s not quite the thing .
When Anna came in in her hat and cape , and her lovely hand rapidly swinging her parasol , and stood beside him , it was with a feeling of relief that Vronsky broke away from the plaintive eyes of Golenishtchev which fastened persistently upon him , and with a fresh rush of love looked at his charming companion , full of life and happiness .
We cannot ... you cannot stay like this , especially now . &quot; &quot; What &apos;s to be done , according to you ? &quot; she asked with the same frivolous irony .
&quot; I saw you were in uncertainty about me , &quot; said Levin , smiling good @-@ naturedly , &quot; but I made haste to plunge into intellectual conversation to smooth over the defects of my attire . &quot; Sergey Ivanovitch , while he kept up a conversation with their hostess , had one ear for his brother , and he glanced askance at him .
But how can I take her away while I &apos;m in the service ?
He doesn &apos;t understand that I &apos;m your wife , that he &apos;s outside , that he &apos;s superfluous .... Don &apos;t let &apos;s talk of him ! ... &quot; &quot; You &apos;re unfair , very unfair , dearest , &quot; said Vronsky , trying to soothe her .
It need not be said that he did not speak of his love to any of his comrades , nor did he betray his secret even in the wildest drinking bouts ( though indeed he was never so drunk as to lose all control of himself ) .
They had visited Venice , Rome , and Naples , and had just arrived at a small Italian town where they meant to stay some time .
She looked forward with a thrill at her heart to the mazurka .
&quot; Wait a minute , wait a minute !
On getting Sviazhsky &apos;s letter with the invitation for shooting , Levin had immediately thought of this ; but in spite of it he had made up his mind that Sviazhsky &apos;s having such views for him was simply his own groundless supposition , and so he would go , all the same .
He looked at her with a look of submissive tenderness , kissed her hand , got up , and , in silence , paced up and down the terrace .
This is the second swarm that has flown away .... Luckily the lads caught them .
Levin read it aloud .
He had forgotten all the agonies and the ecstasies he had lived through with that picture when for several months it had been the one thought haunting him day and night .
&quot; Well , you can go , &quot; answered the princess , gazing at her daughter &apos;s embarrassed face and trying to guess the cause of her embarrassment .
He saw she was saying what she forced herself to say , not what she wanted to say .
The day before yesterday , I met a peasant woman in the evening with a little baby , and asked her where she was going .
Only picture it ! ...
In Christ &apos;s expression there ought to be indeed an expression of pity , since there is an expression of love , of heavenly peace , of readiness for death , and a sense of the vanity of words .
I hate him for his generosity .
Its meaning ran : &quot; If it &apos;s a trick , then calm contempt and departure .
Mother takes me to a ball : it seems to me she only takes me to get me married off as soon as may be , and be rid of me .
She would , like Madame Stahl &apos;s niece , Aline , of whom Varenka had talked to her a great deal , seek out those who were in trouble , wherever she might be living , help them as far as she could , give them the Gospel , read the Gospel to the sick , to criminals , to the dying .
They carry it out in bundles to the roadside , and the cart brings it away . &quot; &quot; Well , we landowners can &apos;t manage well with our laborers , &quot; said Levin , handing him a glass of tea .
&quot; Or has she been very much irritated today ?
He recalled his own criticisms of Tyndall of his complacent satisfaction in the cleverness of his experiments , and for his lack of philosophic insight .
Alexey Alexandrovitch , ready for his speech , stood compressing his crossed fingers , waiting to see if the crack would not come again .
The remainder of the land was still worked on the old system , but these three associated partnerships were the first step to a new organization of the whole , and they completely took up Levin &apos;s time .
It was characteristic of Kitty that she always imagined everything in people in the most favorable light possible , especially so in those she did not know .
Marriage had never presented itself to him as a possibility .
He imagined , probably mistakenly , that this low @-@ necked bodice had been made on his account , and felt that he had no right to look at it , and tried not to look at it ; but he felt that he was to blame for the very fact of the low @-@ necked bodice having been made .
But he could not draw back from the generous word when it was once uttered , even though he felt now , vaguely foreseeing certain eventualities in his intrigue with Madame Karenina , that this generous word had been spoken thoughtlessly , and that even though he were not married he might need all the hundred thousand of income .
He looked with weary and melancholy eyes at the bride and bridegroom , sighed , and putting his right hand out from his vestment , blessed the bridegroom with it , and also with a shade of solicitous tenderness laid the crossed fingers on the bowed head of Kitty .
And now he had to give up that .
What are you trying to find ? &quot; Levin suddenly lost his temper at these words , because at the bottom of his heart he was afraid that it was true - true that he was trying to hold the balance even between communism and the familiar forms , and that this was hardly possible .
And he fancied that her eyes looked with strange fury at him from under the veil .
But she answered , not looking at him , that she was staying to supper .
&quot; And you &apos;ve not been anywhere this evening ?
Darya Alexandrovna meanwhile having pacified the child , and knowing from the sound of the carriage that he had gone off , went back again to her bedroom .
Anything &apos;s better than lying and deceit .
&quot; I understand you , and I understand Liza .
What is it ?
Chapter 6 When Oblonsky asked Levin what had brought him to town , Levin blushed , and was furious with himself for blushing , because he could not answer , &quot; I have come to make your sister @-@ in @-@ law an offer , &quot; though that was precisely what he had come for .
It &apos;s hard to love a woman and do anything .
&quot; One of the officers , they say , has broken two ribs . &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled his smile , which uncovered his teeth , but revealed nothing more .
He did not allow himself to think about it , and he did not think about it ; but all the same though he never admitted it to himself , and had no proofs , not even suspicious evidence , in the bottom of his heart he knew beyond all doubt that he was a deceived husband , and he was profoundly miserable about it .
&quot; Oh , I &apos;m not going to separate the inseparables , &quot; he said in his usual bantering tone .
Towards ten o &apos;clock , when she usually said good @-@ night to her son , and often before going to a ball put him to bed herself , she felt depressed at being so far from him ; and whatever she was talking about , she kept coming back in thought to her curly @-@ headed Seryozha .
&quot; Oh , here &apos;s Madame Stahl , &quot; said Kitty , indicating an invalid carriage , where , propped on pillows , something in gray and blue was lying under a sunshade .
&quot; One must know all the facts , &quot; he said in his thin voice .
&quot; An answer ?
His work was not going well now , and he was glad of a visitor , whoever it might be .
&quot; Vouchsafe to them love made perfect , peace and help , O Lord , we beseech Thee , &quot; the whole church seemed to breathe with the voice of the head deacon .
But if you would like proof .... &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced at his face , and saw that the shrewd , gray eyes were laughing , and seemed to know all about it already .
And then Sviazhsky ( he was there too ) said something too , very handsomely and nobly .
&quot; It was my last effort .
There , looking at her table , with the malachite blotting case lying at the top and an unfinished letter , his thoughts suddenly changed .
&quot; Have you heard the Maltishtcheva woman - the mother , not the daughter - has ordered a costume in _ diable rose _ color ? &quot; &quot; Nonsense !
Chapter 19 In spite of Vronsky &apos;s apparently frivolous life in society , he was a man who hated irregularity .
He saw nothing but her clear , truthful eyes , frightened by the same bliss of love that flooded his heart .
&quot; Ah , I &apos;m very glad ! &quot; The colonel , Demin , had taken a large country house .
He had come now to enjoy such a life at his brother &apos;s .
They don &apos;t know how at every step he &apos;s humiliated me , and been just as pleased with himself .
Anna did not mean to stay to supper , but the master of the house began to press her to do so .
Kamerovsky , look after the coffee ; it &apos;s boiling over .
The priest got him out of his difficulty .
&quot; Look &apos;ee , the little emmets crawling ! &quot; he said , pointing to them , and he shaded his eyes with his hand to look at the sun .
Mademoiselle Varenka , she &apos;s a real angel , allez , &quot; Madame Berthe assented .
&quot; See what comes of your jokes ! &quot; the princess pounced down on her husband .
don &apos;t say it ! &quot; shouted Levin , clutching at the collar of his fur coat with both hands , and muffling him up in it .
But with his eyes shut he saw more distinctly than ever Anna &apos;s face as it had been on the memorable evening before the races .
Stepan Arkadyevitch would have been the companion most congenial to him , but he was going out , he said , to a _ soirée _ , in reality to the ballet .
I was married in the evening too .... &quot; answered Madame Korsunskaya , and she sighed , remembering how charming she had been that day , and how absurdly in love her husband was , and how different it all was now .
Chapter 5 The waiting @-@ room of the celebrated Petersburg lawyer was full when Alexey Alexandrovitch entered it .
Now she was afraid that Vronsky might confine himself to simply flirting with her daughter .
He dashed down the stairs to her , in spite of the governess &apos;s call , and with desperate joy shrieked : &quot; Mother !
The liberal party said that in Russia everything is wrong , and certainly Stepan Arkadyevitch had many debts and was decidedly short of money .
By society , by Russia .
Chapter 22 The rain did not last long , and by the time Vronsky arrived , his shaft @-@ horse trotting at full speed and dragging the trace @-@ horses galloping through the mud , with their reins hanging loose , the sun had peeped out again , the roofs of the summer villas and the old limetrees in the gardens on both sides of the principal streets sparkled with wet brilliance , and from the twigs came a pleasant drip and from the roofs rushing streams of water .
What about Seryozha ? &quot; Anna asked , with sudden eagerness , recollecting her son &apos;s existence for the first time that morning .
&quot; When ? &quot; he murmured in a whisper , gazing in ecstasy at her .
All that was noticeable was the little wilful tendrils of her curly hair that would always break free about her neck and temples .
Besides , at the bottom of his heart he had a desire to try himself , put himself to the test in regard to this girl .
Levin belonged to the second class .
&quot; I thought you were going towards the piano , &quot; said he , going up to her .
The grass was up to their waists in the middle of the hollow , soft , tender , and feathery , spotted here and there among the trees with wild heart &apos;s @-@ ease .
She learned that great personages were displeased with him on this account , and she changed her opinion .
But what a governess ! &quot; ( He vividly recalled the roguish black eyes of Mlle.
I could not bear the way my son looked at me .
The work done was exceptionally much for forty @-@ two men .
Would you be pleased to walk into the garden ? &quot; announced another footman in another room .
Varenka lived with her all the while abroad , and everyone who knew Madame Stahl knew and liked Mademoiselle Varenka , as everyone called her .
Everyone , his mother , his brother , everyone thought fit to interfere in the affairs of his heart .
No one could make out what he said but Kitty ; she alone understood .
After a careful examination and sounding of the bewildered patient , dazed with shame , the celebrated doctor , having scrupulously washed his hands , was standing in the drawing @-@ room talking to the prince .
&quot; Have you got a sledge ?
&quot; Later , later , &quot; she said - &quot; when I am calmer . &quot; But in dreams , when she had no control over her thoughts , her position presented itself to her in all its hideous nakedness .
She was enchanted by her talent , and her voice , and her face , but most of all by her manner , by the way Varenka obviously thought nothing of her singing and was quite unmoved by their praises .
No one knows ; only their host &apos;s valet , in answer to their inquiry whether any &quot; young ladies &quot; are living on the top floor , answered that there were a great many of them about there .
Young Shtcherbatsky , who had not been introduced to Karenin , was trying to look as though he were not in the least conscious of it .
This was evident from the smile in his eyes and the way he said : &quot; Well , it &apos;s a long while since you &apos;ve been to see us , Konstantin Dmitrievitch ! &quot; Not only he knew all about it , but he was unmistakably delighted and making efforts to conceal his joy .
This care for domestic details in Kitty , so opposed to Levin &apos;s ideal of exalted happiness , was at first one of the disappointments ; and this sweet care of her household , the aim of which he did not understand , but could not help loving , was one of the new happy surprises .
&quot; Well , you do praise it , anyway , &quot; said Agafea Mihalovna , &quot; but Konstantin Dmitrievitch , give him what you will - a crust of bread - he &apos;ll eat it and walk away . &quot; Though Levin tried to control himself , he was gloomy and silent .
She was pale , and her lips were quivering .
&quot; Behind Turkin tomorrow or the next day they might begin . &quot; &quot; And the clover ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve sent Vassily and Mishka ; they &apos;re sowing .
I came for this ... to be my wife ! &quot; he brought out , not knowing what he was saying ; but feeling that the most terrible thing was said , he stopped short and looked at her .... She was breathing heavily , not looking at him .
What can I say to him ?
But on the second day after her departure , when Korney gave him a bill from a fashionable draper &apos;s shop , which Anna had forgotten to pay , and announced that the clerk from the shop was waiting , Alexey Alexandrovitch told him to show the clerk up .
Kitty saw indeed , that she was always busy .
He looked at her , and the fury expressed in her face alarmed and amazed him .
&quot; God knows whether they are fully reconciled , &quot; thought Anna , hearing her tone , cold and composed .
Chapter 15 The place fixed on for the stand @-@ shooting was not far above a stream in a little aspen copse .
Princess Tcharskaya only answered with a smile .
The church became so still that the drops of wax could be heard falling from the candles .
She was standing holding herself , as always , very erect , and when Kitty drew near the group she was speaking to the master of the house , her head slightly turned towards him .
The governess had a particularly severe expression .
It &apos;s not my fault , &quot; she said to herself ; but an inner voice told her something else .
You must not ruin her .
The driver &apos;s hand fumbled with something at the lamp , the whip cracked , and the carriage rolled rapidly along the smooth highroad .
Of late his mother , incensed with him on account of his love affair and his leaving Moscow , had given up sending him the money .
Then , to the accompaniment of the band , the colonel himself danced with Petritsky .
You know we &apos;re utterly unlike each other , different tastes and views and everything ; but I know you &apos;re fond of me and understand me , and that &apos;s why I like you awfully .
The gilt on the red ground of the holy picture @-@ stand , and the gilt relief on the pictures , and the silver of the lusters and candlesticks , and the stones of the floor , and the rugs , and the banners above in the choir , and the steps of the altar , and the old blackened books , and the cassocks and surplices - all were flooded with light .
I knew nothing .
&quot; Yes , sir . &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch put on his fur coat and went out onto the steps .
The dinner was as choice as the china , in which Stepan Arkadyevitch was a connoisseur .
&quot; I must talk to you .
All these acquaintances he observed with difficulty concealing their mirth at something ; the same mirth that he had perceived in the lawyer &apos;s eyes , and just now in the eyes of this groom .
What absurd nonsense you are talking ! &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s the truth . &quot; &quot; What , what &apos;s the truth ? &quot; &quot; That I shall die .
&quot; Kitty , haven &apos;t you had some misunderstanding with the Petrovs ? &quot; said the princess , when they were left alone .
&quot; I was meaning to come and see you , &quot; he said ; and then , recollecting with what intention he was trying to see her , he was promptly overcome with confusion and blushed .
But Vronsky asked whether the picture was for sale .
&quot; You speak as if .... &quot; But Kitty was in one of her gusts of fury , and she would not let her finish .
And thinking of nothing but the journey before him , and the revision work he had to do , he went into his room and asked the porter who escorted him where his man was .
Happiness is only in loving and wishing her wishes , thinking her thoughts , that is to say , not freedom at all - that &apos;s happiness ! &quot; &quot; But do I know her ideas , her wishes , her feelings ? &quot; some voice suddenly whispered to him .
&quot; What were you thinking of ? &quot; &quot; Always the same thing , &quot; she said , with a smile .
Where were you ? &quot; &quot; I was late at the Tverskoys , &quot; &quot; said Vronsky .
They respected each other , but were in complete and hopeless disagreement upon almost every subject , not because they belonged to opposite parties , but precisely because they were of the same party ( their enemies refused to see any distinction between their views ) ; but , in that party , each had his own special shade of opinion .
&quot; She is smiling at my suspicions .
I suppose they laugh in their sleeves at their master &apos;s being such a queer fish ? &quot; &quot; No , I don &apos;t think so ; but it &apos;s so delightful , and at the same time such hard work , that one has no time to think about it . &quot; &quot; But how will you do about dining with them ?
Seeing now clearly what was _ the most important _ , Kitty was not satisfied with being enthusiastic over it ; she at once gave herself up with her whole soul to the new life that was opening to her .
He was a clever and wonderfully good @-@ hearted man .
First it was the medicine he had poured out for the patient and spilt over the spoon , then the midwife &apos;s white hands , then the queer posture of Alexey Alexandrovitch on the floor beside the bed .
How put an end , Alexey ? &quot; she said softly .
But at once she felt that by that very word &quot; forbidden &quot; she had shown that she acknowledged certain rights over him , and by that very fact was encouraging him to speak of love .
The day after his arrival he was driving back from calling on the governor @-@ general .
Kindly wait your turn . &quot; &quot; Then I must trouble you to give him my card , &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch said with dignity , seeing the impossibility of preserving his incognito .
He caught a glimpse of the broad , smooth , black and piebald back of Hollandka .
Masha , bring supper for three .
She went up to the table , wrote to her husband , &quot; I have received your letter . - A. &quot; ; and , ringing the bell , gave it to the footman .
Not a day has passed that Kostya has not mentioned you , and been anxious . &quot; But the sick man &apos;s interest did not last long .
He listened , and heard in a strange , mad whisper words repeated : &quot; I did not appreciate it , did not make enough of it .
&quot; This is getting indecorous , &quot; whispered one lady , with an expressive glance at Madame Karenina , Vronsky , and her husband .
He did not think that the Christian law that he had been all his life trying to follow , enjoined on him to forgive and love his enemies ; but a glad feeling of love and forgiveness for his enemies filled his heart .
One simply strokes the bristles of dead women .
Madame Karenina seated herself in the carriage , and Stepan Arkadyevitch saw with surprise that her lips were quivering , and she was with difficulty restraining her tears .
Chapter 30 The raging tempest rushed whistling between the wheels of the carriages , about the scaffolding , and round the corner of the station .
He pulled up the blind and rang the bell loudly .
His lips twitched .
Such men are unfaithful , but their home and wife are sacred to them .
Sviazhsky was an extremely advanced man .
But the spiritualists have begun with tables writing for them , and spirits appearing to them , and have only later started saying that it is an unknown force . &quot; Vronsky listened attentively to Levin , as he always did listen , obviously interested in his words .
&quot; I mustn &apos;t , mustn &apos;t think , &quot; she said to herself .
But he felt ashamed of the feeling , and at once he opened , as it were , the arms of his soul , and with a softened feeling of joy and expectation , now he hoped with all his heart that it was his brother .
The last of the mowers were just ending their rows while the foremost snatched up their coats onto their shoulders , and crossed the road towards Mashkin Upland .
&quot; Yes ... no , &quot; said Levin , hesitating over his words .
He sat in one corner , stretched his legs out on the front seat , and sank into meditation .
He who had been such a careful father , had from the end of that winter become peculiarly frigid to his son , and adopted to him just the same bantering tone he used with his wife .
Darya Alexandrovna at that moment pitied him with all her heart .
Just now I looked at the sky , and there was nothing in it - only two white streaks .
She sat down and began questioning Levin about his life in the country .
And without considering , without noticing whether there was anyone in the room or not , he flung his arms round her , and began to cover her face , her hands , her neck with kisses .
The priest paused for some time , as though meditating .
Tearing open the telegram , he read it through , guessing at the words , misspelt as they always are in telegrams , and his face brightened .
&quot; Even when .... &quot; She stopped and went on again , looking at him resolutely with her truthful eyes , &quot; Even when I thrust from me my happiness .
Am I afraid to look it straight in the face ?
The husband . &quot; Only now for the first time did Vronsky realize clearly the fact that there was a person attached to her , a husband .
We admit the existence of electricity , of which we know nothing .
And I know that he &apos;s her favorite ; still one can see how chivalrous he is .... Well , for instance , she told me that he had wanted to give up all his property to his brother , that he had done something extraordinary when he was quite a child , saved a woman out of the water .
&quot; I don &apos;t like such grandeur . &quot; Sergey Ivanovitch was talking to Darya Dmitrievna , jestingly assuring her that the custom of going away after the wedding was becoming common because newly married people always felt a little ashamed of themselves .
I don &apos;t want these condolences and humbug ! &quot; &quot; Kitty , you &apos;re unjust . &quot; &quot; Why are you tormenting me ? &quot; &quot; But I ... quite the contrary ...
Shrinking from the cold , Levin walked rapidly , looking at the ground .
&quot; They &apos;ve all adopted that manner .
He liked the work so much that he had several times tried his hand at mowing since .
&quot; Thank God you &apos;ve come !
&quot; How glad I am you have come , &quot; Dolly said with a frightened smile , meeting him in the outer drawing @-@ room .
She remembered the ball , remembered Vronsky and his face of slavish adoration , remembered all her conduct with him : there was nothing shameful .
&quot; Full , full reconciliation , full , &quot; thought Anna ; &quot; thank God ! &quot; and rejoicing that she was the cause of it , she went up to Dolly and kissed her .
&quot; But perhaps I am wrong , perhaps it was not so ? &quot; And again she recalled all she had seen .
&quot; They &apos;re simple destruction , &quot; said he .
Stepan Arkadyevitch was not merely liked by all who knew him for his good humor , but for his bright disposition , and his unquestionable honesty .
Then she described the pity she had felt , first for her brother , and afterwards for Dolly .
&quot; Well , doctor , decide our fate , &quot; said the princess .
But at the same time , he felt that the turning @-@ point he had been longing for had come now ; that it was impossible to go on concealing things from her husband , and it was inevitable in one way or another that they should soon put an end to their unnatural position .
&quot; Did you notice how she fell down ? ... &quot; &quot; Oh , please , don &apos;t let us talk about Nilsson !
&quot; Three people have used that very phrase about Kaulbach to me today already , just as though they had made a compact about it .
Living the old life , she was horrified at herself , at her utter insurmountable callousness to all her own past , to things , to habits , to the people she had loved , who loved her - to her mother , who was wounded by her indifference , to her kind , tender father , till then dearer than all the world .
Hi !
Frou @-@ Frou was still trembling as though in a fever .
I have come simply to consult you as a preliminary step .
Nothing better could be wished for .
&quot; I can &apos;t ask her to be my wife merely because she can &apos;t be the wife of the man she wanted to marry , &quot; he said to himself .
Here it &apos;s time they got to work in the fields . &quot; &quot; But what were they doing in the winter , then ? &quot; &quot; But what did you want the carpenter for ? &quot; &quot; Where are the hurdles for the calves &quot; paddock ? &quot; &quot; I ordered them to be got ready .
Dolly and Anna dined alone with the children and the English governess .
Pava , uneasy , began lowing , but when Levin put the calf close to her she was soothed , and , sighing heavily , began licking her with her rough tongue .
Now his whole soul was full of remorse that he had begun this conversation with Stepan Arkadyevitch .
Stepan Arkadyevitch remembered his joke about this punctual , bald watchmaker , &quot; that the German was wound up for a whole lifetime himself , to wind up watches , &quot; and he smiled .
And besides , you will only give her a chance for talking scandal , while here you arouse none but such different feelings of the highest and most opposite kind , &quot; he said to her .
You cannot but know , since the Lord God in His infinite mercy has revealed it to us .
The handsome , stately head @-@ deacon wearing a silver robe and his curly locks standing out at each side of his head , stepped smartly forward , and lifting his stole on two fingers , stood opposite the priest .
She had scarcely entered the ballroom and reached the throng of ladies , all tulle , ribbons , lace , and flowers , waiting to be asked to dance - Kitty was never one of that throng - when she was asked for a waltz , and asked by the best partner , the first star in the hierarchy of the ballroom , a renowned director of dances , a married man , handsome and well @-@ built , Yegorushka Korsunsky .
I knew him !
These principles were possibly not reasonable and not good , but they were of unfailing certainty , and so long as he adhered to them , Vronsky felt that his heart was at peace and he could hold his head up .
&quot; Yes , I am out of temper , and do you know why ?
&quot; Won &apos;t you have supper ?
She knew what had kept her from it , she knew that she had been ashamed .
And to make time to get through all that lay before him every day , he adhered to the strictest punctuality .
&quot; I marvel at the second sight of lovers , &quot; she added with a smile , so that no one but he could hear ; &quot; _ she wasn &apos;t there _ .
Today , almost for the first time , I set to work seriously , and what happened ?
&quot; Of course not ; not a bit , and no reason to be .
And society &apos;s so constituted that the harder they work , the greater the profit of the merchants and landowners , while they stay beasts of burden to the end .
Because a just idea cannot but be fruitful .
And I think your action was good in itself , but you didn &apos;t do it quite in the way you ought to have done . &quot; &quot; What &apos;s done can &apos;t be undone , and you know I never go back on what I &apos;ve done .
He went to the hay fields and examined the stacks .
They can be bought either by money or by favor .
&quot; Well , and what &apos;s this Levin going to do ? &quot; asked the princess .
Why didn &apos;t you fight it out ?
It was Dolly with her children .
Dolly , ask him to dinner .
She would have gone , but he held her back .
I am in a hurry , because I &apos;ve no time , I &apos;ve not long left to live ; the fever will begin directly and I shall understand nothing more .
&quot; Oh , I have had a letter from Moscow .
Lord help me ! &quot; thought Levin , and he flew towards the old Frenchwoman with the gray ringlets , who was sitting on a bench .
She , his Dolly , forever fussing and worrying over household details , and limited in her ideas , as he considered , was sitting perfectly still with the letter in her hand , looking at him with an expression of horror , despair , and indignation .
But that did not prevent such quarrels from happening again , and exceedingly often too , on the most unexpected and trivial grounds .
Take away the broth .
&quot; And ...
&quot; Don &apos;t say that , Dolly .
&quot; Please don &apos;t argue , &quot; said Levin , &quot; but do as you &apos;re told . &quot; &quot; Yes , sir , &quot; answered Vassily , and he took the horse &apos;s head .
Often , too , talking to the peasants and explaining to them all the advantages of the plan , Levin felt that the peasants heard nothing but the sound of his voice , and were firmly resolved , whatever he might say , not to let themselves be taken in .
Oblonsky had more than once experienced this extreme sense of aloofness , instead of intimacy , coming on after dinner , and he knew what to do in such cases .
I see that , but you ought not to keep it up .
&quot; You are radiant with health and happiness ! &quot; said Dolly , almost with envy .
&quot; Yes , you see we &apos;re growing up , &quot; she said to him , glancing towards Kitty , &quot; and growing old .
The guard &apos;s words roused him , and forced him to think of his mother and his approaching meeting with her .
&quot; Only just in time .
And , above all , talk it over with her .
&quot; Yes , Kitty &apos;s ill .... Well , it can &apos;t be helped ; I &apos;m very sorry , &quot; he thought .
&quot; It &apos;s ready , sir ; it &apos;s like a razor , cuts of itself , &quot; said Tit , taking off his cap with a smile and giving him the scythe .
Was ever a woman so miserable as I am ? ... &quot; &quot; No ; I will break through it , I will break through it ! &quot; she cried , jumping up and keeping back her tears .
&quot; Get up , don &apos;t go on sleeping , &quot; said Yashvin , going behind the partition and giving Petritsky , who was lying with ruffled hair and with his nose in the pillow , a prod on the shoulder .
But she could not help being grateful to him for his attitude to her , and showing that she appreciated it .
&quot; Positively and conclusively &quot; were the merchant &apos;s favorite words .
&quot; Come , is Babylon reformed , or have you degenerated ? &quot; she added , glancing with a simper at Kitty .
He saw nothing but death or the advance towards death in everything .
She did not know herself why and wherefore , but the arranging of her house had an irresistible attraction for her .
Chapter 5 Stepan Arkadyevitch had learned easily at school , thanks to his excellent abilities , but he had been idle and mischievous , and therefore was one of the lowest in his class .
&quot; I understand and appreciate your attitude to him ; but I shall go and see him . &quot; &quot; If you want to , do ; but I shouldn &apos;t advise it , &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch .
He found the liver considerably enlarged , and the digestive powers weakened , while the course of mineral waters had been quite without effect .
&quot; No chance of my losing .
A slight wind arose , and the sky looked gray and sullen .
&quot; Take astronomy , take botany , or zoology with its system of general principles . &quot; &quot; I cannot quite agree with that , &quot; responded Alexey Alexandrovitch &quot; It seems to me that one must admit that the very process of studying the forms of language has a peculiarly favorable influence on intellectual development .
And just as always he returned in July and at once fell to work as usual with increased energy .
&quot; Yes , I understand it all now , &quot; said Darya Alexandrovna .
The figure from a lifeless imagined thing had become living , and such that it could never be changed .
Anna , left alone , spent the time till dinner in assisting at her son &apos;s dinner ( he dined apart from his parents ) and in putting her things in order , and in reading and answering the notes and letters which had accumulated on her table .
&quot; She &apos;s very restless , &quot; answered the nurse in a whisper .
At the same instant , under Vronsky &apos;s eyes , right before him flashed the palings of the barrier .
A secretary , with the good @-@ humored deference common to everyone in Stepan Arkadyevitch &apos;s office , came up with papers , and began to speak in the familiar and easy tone which had been introduced by Stepan Arkadyevitch .
It &apos;s nothing , sir , so long as there &apos;s health and a clear conscience . &quot; Levin looked intently at her , surprised at how well she knew his thought .
I don &apos;t understand , &quot; said Anna contemptuously .
Frou @-@ Frou &apos;s shoulder , beginning by now to be dark with sweat , was even with Gladiator &apos;s back .
The old people were obviously muddled for a moment , and did not quite know whether it was they who were in love again or their daughter .
From his tone both Kitty and Anna knew that a reconciliation had taken place .
They had all taken up that attitude to his plans , and so now he was not angered by it , but mortified , and felt all the more roused to struggle against this , as it seemed , elemental force continually ranged against him , for which he could find no other expression than &quot; as God wills . &quot; &quot; If we can manage it , Konstantin Dmitrievitch , &quot; said the bailiff .
&quot; Where &apos;s my spade , mamma ? &quot; &quot; I speak French , and you must too . &quot; The little girl tried to say it in French , but could not remember the French for spade ; the mother prompted her , and then told her in French where to look for the spade .
Already she heard bells ringing to announce her arrival ahead of her , and Princess Tverskaya &apos;s footman was standing at the open door waiting for her to go forward into the inner rooms .
Chapter 2 Soon after the doctor , Dolly had arrived .
So now you know whom you &apos;ve to do with .
It would be the best thing that could be . &quot; &quot; But you &apos;re not making a mistake ?
On the pretext of wanting to give some dinner to her dolls , she had asked the governess &apos;s permission to take her share of tart to the nursery , and had taken it instead to her brother .
When he was back in the carriage , he kept unceasingly going over every position in which he had seen her , every word she had uttered , and before his fancy , making his heart faint with emotion , floated pictures of a possible future .
I tell you straight out , if I were you , I should go back with me to Moscow , and .... &quot; &quot; No ; I don &apos;t know whether you know it or not , but I don &apos;t care .
This repetition checked the rising up of fresh images and memories , which he felt were thronging in his brain .
Why , I &apos;ve grown up from a little thing with them .
&quot; I &apos;ll try not to let it go , &quot; he said , taking his stand behind Tit , and waiting for the time to begin .
Vronsky could not but feel this , and the parts were suddenly reversed .
&quot; Let us go , if you like , &quot; he said in French , but Anna was listening to the general and did not notice her husband .
But what is more probable and what would doubtless occur - I should be killed or wounded .
The ladies of the Sviazhsky household were particularly delightful .
&quot; Why , it &apos;s actually you , Levin , at last ! &quot; he said with a friendly mocking smile , scanning Levin as he approached .
If he hadn &apos;t heard there was such a thing as love , he would never have used the word .
&quot; We shall be disturbed here .
&quot; Because I &apos;m setting off , &quot; he repeated , as though he had a liking for the phrase .
All I say is , give such rights as our local self @-@ government to any other European people - why , the Germans or the English would have worked their way to freedom from them , while we simply turn them into ridicule . &quot; &quot; But how can it be helped ? &quot; said Levin penitently .
She knew that in politics , in philosophy , in theology , Alexey Alexandrovitch often had doubts , and made investigations ; but on questions of art and poetry , and , above all , of music , of which he was totally devoid of understanding , he had the most distinct and decided opinions .
Society ?
No sort of necessity ! &quot; she compressed her lips , and dropped her burning eyes to his hands with their swollen veins .
Surely women in society can talk to whom they please .
He took off the mantelpiece , where he had put it yesterday , a little box of sweets , and gave her two , picking out her favorites , a chocolate and a fondant .
The princess smiled that what was taking place just now in her soul seemed to the poor child so immense and so important .
And thereupon he suddenly remembered that he was not sleeping in his wife &apos;s room , but in his study , and why : the smile vanished from his face , he knitted his brows .
Though both had often heard a great deal about the saying that the one who steps first on the rug will be the head of the house , neither Levin nor Kitty were capable of recollecting it , as they took the few steps towards it .
It always seemed to her that he understood her better than anyone in the family , though he did not say much about her .
There self @-@ interest did come in .
Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed at this , and liked it .
And the sweet face covered with tears hid itself in Darya Alexandrovna &apos;s skirt .
Nikolay had heard ; but these words produced no effect on him .
&quot; But women , my boy , they &apos;re the pivot everything turns upon .
I was bargaining for some wheat of him , and a pretty price I offered too . &quot; &quot; Why should I give you my goods for nothing ?
And so the silence lasted for some time .
Buy land ?
Bakers , closed shops , night @-@ cabmen , porters sweeping the pavements flashed past his eyes , and he watched it all , trying to smother the thought of what was awaiting him , and what he dared not hope for , and yet was hoping for .
They talked it over , and decided that Petritsky and Kedrov must go with Vronsky to Venden &apos;s to apologize .
&quot; You know each other , of course ? &quot; &quot; I should think so , &quot; said Vronsky , with a bright smile , pressing the baroness &apos;s little hand .
The other , a little younger , was lying in the grass leaning on his elbows , with his tangled , flaxen head in his hands , staring at the water with his dreamy blue eyes .
But his whole face suddenly bore the solemn rigidity of the dead , and his expression did not change during the whole time of the drive home .
He suddenly felt that what he had regarded as nervous agitation was on the contrary a blissful spiritual condition that gave him all at once a new happiness he had never known .
&quot; And the worst of it all , &quot; thought he , &quot; is that just now , at the very moment when my great work is approaching completion &quot; ( he was thinking of the project he was bringing forward at the time ) , &quot; when I stand in need of all my mental peace and all my energies , just now this stupid worry should fall foul of me .
Having read the letter , he raised his eyes to her , and there was no determination in them .
At first they imagined that the bride and bridegroom would arrive immediately , and attached no importance at all to their being late .
&quot; I want nothing , nothing but this happiness , &quot; he thought , staring at the bone button of the bell in the space between the windows , and picturing to himself Anna just as he had seen her last time .
To be silent , also impossible .
&quot; And so you were saying ? ... &quot; he said .
The mistress is at home .
Holding herself extremely erect , as always , looking straight before her , and moving with her swift , resolute , and light step , that distinguished her from all other society women , she crossed the short space to her hostess , shook hands with her , smiled , and with the same smile looked around at Vronsky .
Stepan Arkadyevitch , going down , carefully took the canvas cover off his varnished gun case with his own hands , and opening it , began to get ready his expensive new @-@ fashioned gun .
&quot; He obviously wants to offend me , &quot; pursued Sergey Ivanovitch ; &quot; but he cannot offend me , and I should have wished with all my heart to assist him , but I know it &apos;s impossible to do that . &quot; &quot; Yes , yes , &quot; repeated Levin .
Now mind and don &apos;t alter anything in the house , but make haste and get married , and make everything as it used to be again .
Alexey Alexandrovitch ordered tea to be sent him , sat down to the table , and taking the guidebook , began considering the route of his journey .
Chapter 5 In the church there was all Moscow , all the friends and relations ; and during the ceremony of plighting troth , in the brilliantly lighted church , there was an incessant flow of discreetly subdued talk in the circle of gaily dressed women and girls , and men in white ties , frockcoats , and uniforms .
&quot; I have not lighted the fire .
But what &apos;s the use of getting in a rage .
He suddenly felt that the very thing that was the source of his sufferings had become the source of his spiritual joy ; that what had seemed insoluble while he was judging , blaming , and hating , had become clear and simple when he forgave and loved .
He felt that he could not endure the weight of universal contempt and exasperation , which he had distinctly seen in the face of the clerk and of Korney , and of everyone , without exception , whom he had met during those two days .
Can you ? &quot; she said to Marya Nikolaevna .
And when was there time for that cloud @-@ shell to form ?
He addressed Sappho : &quot; You &apos;ve lost your bet .
If I had the money .... &quot; &quot; Leave me in peace , for God &apos;s sake ! &quot; Mihailov shrieked , with tears in his voice , and , stopping his ears , he went off into his working room , the other side of a partition wall , and closed the door after him .
&quot; I am sorry I told you , &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch , shaking his head at his younger brother &apos;s excitement .
He moved away and stood behind them .
We had to ask them , and I made them sauce for eighteen pence , and everybody was very much pleased with it .
They were walking on one side of the arcade , trying to avoid Levin , who was walking on the other side .
The smartly dressed and healthy @-@ looking nurse , frightened at the idea of losing her place , muttered something to herself , and covering her bosom , smiled contemptuously at the idea of doubts being cast on her abundance of milk .
&quot; It &apos;s I , &quot; said a firm , pleasant , woman &apos;s voice , and the stern , pockmarked face of Matrona Philimonovna , the nurse , was thrust in at the doorway .
Anna sat down at the hearth with an English novel and waited for her husband .
The mere notion of this so exasperated Alexey Alexandrovitch , that directly it rose to his mind he groaned with inward agony , and got up and changed his place in the carriage , and for a long while after , he sat with scowling brows , wrapping his numbed and bony legs in the fleecy rug .
&quot; I don &apos;t quite understand the meaning of your words , &quot; he said , handing her the cup .
Alexey Alexandrovitch had begun to speak boldly , but as he realized plainly what he was speaking of , the dismay she was feeling infected him too .
And her lips began trembling again .
The brothers had to drive through the woods to reach the meadows .
tchk ! &quot; came the snapping sound of Stepan Arkadyevitch cocking his gun .
Madame Sviazhskaya had just told him at tea that they had that summer invited a German expert in bookkeeping from Moscow , who for a consideration of five hundred roubles had investigated the management of their property , and found that it was costing them a loss of three thousand odd roubles .
&quot; Kitty !
&quot; Surely you must be dull in the country in the winter , aren &apos;t you ? &quot; she said .
Liza Merkalova was his wife &apos;s niece , and he spent all his leisure hours with her .
&quot; Isn &apos;t he right that everything in the world is base and loathsome ?
Vronsky was in front with his mother .
this ? &quot; she asked , pointing to the letter .
But if he had been asked , and those who looked at it &quot; properly &quot; had been asked , exactly how they did look at it , both he and they would have been greatly puzzled to answer .
He dressed in haste , and as though carrying his cup full of wrath , and fearing to spill any over , fearing to lose with his wrath the energy necessary for the interview with his wife , he went into her room directly he heard she was up .
You know all about such things .
To go where ?
When she said : &quot; Indeed I do .... &quot; &quot; Well , what then ?
He felt more for his son than before .
Miss Hoole is calling you to tea , &quot; she said , tearing the children from her , and sending them off to the dining @-@ room .
&quot; I imagine it won &apos;t be possible to avoid going .
Who &apos;s there ? &quot; asked Stepan Arkadyevitch , hearing the rustle of a woman &apos;s dress at the door .
To put himself in thought and feeling in another person &apos;s place was a spiritual exercise not natural to Alexey Alexandrovitch .
&quot; Apart from formal divorce , One might still do like Karibanov , Paskudin , and that good fellow Dram - that is , separate from one &apos;s wife , &quot; he went on thinking , when he had regained his composure .
Those sweet , loving eyes !
And , do you know , if I may venture to advise you , you should go and see her today .
And Vronsky , remembering his dream , felt the same terror filling his soul .
&quot; Then it must be all right , &quot; he thought .
But at that very moment Tit stopped of his own accord , and stooping down picked up some grass , rubbed his scythe , and began whetting it .
But later too , and the next day and the third day , she still found no words in which she could express the complexity of her feelings ; indeed , she could not even find thoughts in which she could clearly think out all that was in her soul .
There remained only the last ditch , filled with water and five feet wide .
Him she was seeing every day , and you she had not seen for a long while .
To look out yonder now , &quot; said Vassily , pointing , &quot; it does one &apos;s heart good . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a lovely spring , Vassily . &quot; &quot; Why , it &apos;s a spring such as the old men don &apos;t remember the like of .
He was annoyed , and reprimanded the bailiff .
Your very motive is different .
It was only hard work when he had to break off the motion , which had become unconscious , and to think ; when he had to mow round a hillock or a tuft of sorrel .
She will be no one &apos;s wife , she will be lost ! &quot; &quot; What can I do ? &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch , raising his shoulders and his eyebrows .
When on the evening that he arrived home he informed the bailiff of his plans , the latter with visible pleasure agreed with what he said so long as he was pointing out that all that had been done up to that time was stupid and useless .
So I lived eight years .
Everything he saw from the carriage window , everything in that cold pure air , in the pale light of the sunset , was as fresh , and gay , and strong as he was himself : the roofs of the houses shining in the rays of the setting sun , the sharp outlines of fences and angles of buildings , the figures of passers @-@ by , the carriages that met him now and then , the motionless green of the trees and grass , the fields with evenly drawn furrows of potatoes , and the slanting shadows that fell from the houses , and trees , and bushes , and even from the rows of potatoes - everything was bright like a pretty landscape just finished and freshly varnished .
I &apos;m not jealous : I believe you when you &apos;re here ; but when you &apos;re away somewhere leading your life , so incomprehensible to me .... &quot; She turned away from him , pulled the hook at last out of the crochet work , and rapidly , with the help of her forefinger , began working loop after loop of the wool that was dazzling white in the lamplight , while the slender wrist moved swiftly , nervously in the embroidered cuff .
Yes , yes , I know you &apos;re all perfection ; but what am I to do if I &apos;m bad ?
Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s permanent summer villa was in Peterhof , and the Countess Lidia Ivanovna used as a rule to spend the summer there , close to Anna , and constantly seeing her .
&quot; I hope you believe in my love for my sister and my sincere affection and respect for you , &quot; he said , reddening .
The delight he had experienced in the work itself , and the consequent greater intimacy with the peasants , the envy he felt of them , of their life , the desire to adopt that life , which had been to him that night not a dream but an intention , the execution of which he had thought out in detail - all this had so transformed his view of the farming of the land as he had managed it , that he could not take his former interest in it , and could not help seeing that unpleasant relation between him and the workpeople which was the foundation of it all .
One dress , Tanya &apos;s , which the English governess had undertaken , cost Darya Alexandrovna much loss of temper .
No .
She must take her son and go away .
She felt so sinful , so guilty , that nothing was left her but to humiliate herself and beg forgiveness ; and as now there was no one in her life but him , to him she addressed her prayer for forgiveness .
He did not understand Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s feeling , but he felt that it was something higher and even unattainable for him with his view of life .
He was equally unable to work when he was cold and when he was too much affected and saw everything too much .
&quot; Well , countess , you have met your son , and I my brother , &quot; she said .
Without thinking , without asking herself how and what , she had gone up to him , and did as she was doing .
Anything I can do , I am ready to do anything !
It was the time when there comes a brief pause in the toil of the fields before the beginning of the labors of harvest - every year recurring , every year straining every nerve of the peasants .
I had even forgotten him .
Having carefully considered everything , I am writing now with the object of fulfilling that promise .
How am I to set about it ? &quot; he said to himself , trying to express to himself all the thoughts and feelings he had passed through in that brief night .
&quot; How was it you used to say you would never wear European dress again ? &quot; he said , scanning his new suit , obviously cut by a French tailor .
Anna , who had thought she knew her husband so well , was amazed at his appearance when he went in to her .
Where ? ...
Do you know , Myakov has promised me a place there , and I &apos;m going into the service .
As to paying the money down , there &apos;ll be no hitch there . &quot; Levin , who had meanwhile been putting his gun away in the cupboard , was just going out of the door , but catching the merchant &apos;s words , he stopped .
From a child up .... &quot; he was beginning with flashing eyes , apparently catching Levin &apos;s enthusiasm , just as people catch yawning .
And what am I myself ?
&quot; Oh , yes , &quot; she said , and she began telling him about everything from the beginning : her journey with Countess Vronskaya , her arrival , the accident at the station .
I can &apos;t understand the husband &apos;s rôle in it . &quot; &quot; The husband ?
He sent the men to mow some clover for hay , picking out the worst patches where the clover was overgrown with grass and weeds and of no use for seed ; again and again they mowed the best acres of clover , justifying themselves by the pretense that the bailiff had told them to , and trying to pacify him with the assurance that it would be splendid hay ; but he knew that it was owing to those acres being so much easier to mow .
&quot; Look sharp , my girl ! &quot; the old man shouted after her , good @-@ humoredly , and he went up to Levin .
On the third day it was the same thing , and the doctors said there was hope .
His chief object , to define the position with the least amount of disturbance possible , would not be attained by divorce either .
Levin was wondering what that change in Kitty &apos;s expression had meant , and alternately assuring himself that there was hope , and falling into despair , seeing clearly that his hopes were insane , and yet all the while he felt himself quite another man , utterly unlike what he had been before her smile and those words , &quot; Good @-@ bye till this evening . &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch was absorbed during the drive in composing the menu of the dinner .
From the uplands he could get a view of the shaded cut part of the meadow below , with its grayish ridges of cut grass , and the black heaps of coats , taken off by the mowers at the place from which they had started cutting .
But Sergey Ivanovitch , who had been talking with far less heat and one @-@ sidedness than the professor , and who had sufficient breadth of mind to answer the professor , and at the same time to comprehend the simple and natural point of view from which the question was put , smiled and said : &quot; That question we have no right to answer as yet . &quot; &quot; We have not the requisite data , &quot; chimed in the professor , and he went back to his argument .
The good @-@ looking young woman in clogs , swinging the empty pails on the yoke , ran on before him to the well for water .
He too , like her felt glad and happy .
But I &apos;ll go and wash . &quot; &quot; Yes , go along , go along , and I &apos;ll come to you directly , &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch , shaking his head as he looked at his brother .
&quot; To me you &apos;re nicer than anyone in the world . &quot; &quot; I know that , &quot; said Seryozha , smiling .
&quot; You see the sort of man he is , &quot; she said , with a shaking voice ; &quot; he .... &quot; &quot; Forgive me , but I rejoice at it , &quot; Vronsky interrupted .
brandy for your master and cucumbers , &quot; he shouted , obviously taking pleasure in the sound of his own voice .
The porter , Kapitonitch , looked queer in an old coat , without a tie , and in slippers .
No , for God &apos;s sake , you are mistaken , &quot; said Dolly , putting her hands to her temples and closing her eyes .
Now it &apos;s time for me to go .
&quot; I &apos;m much obliged for the gratification , my humble respects &quot; - that &apos;s all the tragedy .
&quot; You don &apos;t look quite well , &quot; she said .
&quot; Yes , I wished ...
But he had not seen her for three days , and as her husband had just returned from abroad , he did not know whether she would be able to meet him today or not , and he did not know how to find out .
For the first instant Levin saw an expression of eager curiosity in the eyes with which Kitty looked at this awful woman , so incomprehensible to her ; but it lasted only a single instant .
And at once in the conversation with the aide @-@ de @-@ camp Oblonsky had a sense of relaxation and relief after the conversation with Levin , which always put him to too great a mental and spiritual strain .
If ever at any moment she had been asked what she was thinking of , she could have answered truly : of the same thing , of her happiness and her unhappiness .
The nurse , with a gesture of despair , went to it , took it from the wet @-@ nurse &apos;s arms , and began walking up and down , rocking it .
Just as they were arranging themselves round the table , and Levin was on the point of retiring , the old prince came in , and after greeting the ladies , addressed Levin .
&quot; Why do you think so ? &quot; said Levin , so as to say something .
Kitty , who played well , accompanied her .
&quot; I must have physical exercise , or my temper &apos;ll certainly be ruined , &quot; he thought , and he determined he would go mowing , however awkward he might feel about it with his brother or the peasants .
You &apos;re out of temper . &quot; &quot; Not the least , &quot; said Levin gloomily , as they drove up to the house .
&quot; That is out of the question in the present case , &quot; he said .
Konstantin Levin was the only person who had not arrived .
Still more delightful were the moments when they reached the stream where the rows ended , and the old man rubbed his scythe with the wet , thick grass , rinsed its blade in the fresh water of the stream , ladled out a little in a tin dipper , and offered Levin a drink .
&quot; But the matter is settled , it &apos;s useless thinking about it , &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch told himself .
And the more he tried to compose himself , the more breathless he found himself .
The voices were silent , and he went in .
Sometimes when his breathing was painful , he said , &quot; Oh , my God ! &quot; Sometimes when he was choking he muttered angrily , &quot; Ah , the devil ! &quot; Levin could not sleep for a long while , hearing him .
He was conscious that he loved the boy less , and always tried to be fair ; but the boy felt it , and did not respond with a smile to his father &apos;s chilly smile .
That impression had been favorable .
The prince returned thinner , with the skin hanging in loose bags on his cheeks , but in the most cheerful frame of mind .
&quot; How about the trousseau ? &quot; &quot; Will there really be a trousseau and all that ? &quot; Levin thought with horror .
Levin , unobserved by the peasants , still lay on the haycock , and still looked on and listened and mused .
She didn &apos;t tell you so ? &quot; &quot; No , she has said nothing to me either of one or the other ; she &apos;s too proud .
Only to stretch my legs a little .
At once the whole of his picture lived before him in all the indescribable complexity of everything living .
You know I had resolved on a divorce , and had even begun to take proceedings .
I did so want to see you , yesterday especially .
&quot; Have you quite settled about the forest with Ryabinin ? &quot; asked Levin .
He began to speak , trying to find words not to dissuade but simply to soothe her .
They are ready , invented . &quot; &quot; But if they don &apos;t do for us , if they &apos;re stupid ? &quot; said Levin .
But her mother saw them in a different light .
&quot; And I think you would be a first @-@ rate medium , &quot; said Countess Nordston ; &quot; there &apos;s something enthusiastic in you . &quot; Levin opened his mouth , was about to say something , reddened , and said nothing .
&quot; Even after marriage ? &quot; said the ambassador &apos;s wife playfully .
How are you , young man ? &quot; And he gave his hand to the scared child .
She was fond of Kitty , and her affection for her showed itself , as the affection of married women for girls always does , in the desire to make a match for Kitty after her own ideal of married happiness ; she wanted her to marry Vronsky .
He stayed with them one hour , two , three , talking of all sorts of subjects but the one thing that filled his heart , and did not observe that he was boring them dreadfully , and that it was long past their bedtime .
Anna glanced inquiringly into her face , and blushed with a scared look .
When a hillock came he changed his action , and at one time with the heel , and at another with the tip of his scythe , clipped the hillock round both sides with short strokes .
Vassily was not to blame for their having filled up his cart with unsifted earth , but still it was annoying .
A handsome head waiter , with thick pomaded hair parted from the neck upwards , an evening coat , a broad white cambric shirt front , and a bunch of trinkets hanging above his rounded stomach , stood with his hands in the full curve of his pockets , looking contemptuously from under his eyelids while he gave some frigid reply to a gentleman who had stopped him .
Be generous , leave him to me . &quot; Up to this point she wrote rapidly and naturally , but the appeal to his generosity , a quality she did not recognize in him , and the necessity of winding up the letter with something touching , pulled her up .
You can &apos;t do him any good ; still , do as you please . &quot; &quot; Very likely I can &apos;t do any good , but I feel - especially at such a moment - but that &apos;s another thing - I feel I could not be at peace . &quot; &quot; Well , that I don &apos;t understand , &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch .
&quot; Half an hour . &quot; &quot; How many times have I told you to tell me at once ? &quot; &quot; One must let you drink your coffee in peace , at least , &quot; said Matvey , in the affectionately gruff tone with which it was impossible to be angry .
I cared for someone once , and I used to sing him that song . &quot; Kitty with big , wide @-@ open eyes gazed silently , sympathetically at Varenka .
With Sergey Ivanovitch it was quite the contrary .
His eyes were wide open as though he had never been asleep .
&quot; Come , really though , &quot; said the elder brother , with a frown on his handsome , clever face , &quot; there &apos;s a limit to everything .
&quot; Ah , I don &apos;t care ! &quot; she seemed to say to him , and she did not once glance at him again .
And then the mother wishes it , &quot; he added .
A foreign prince , who had come on a visit to Petersburg , was put under his charge , and he had to show him the sights worth seeing .
She &apos;s so nice , so charming .
Painful as it is to me to believe it , I see that it is so , and cannot be otherwise .
He knew that by this term was understood a mechanical facility for painting or drawing , entirely apart from its subject .
&quot; It &apos;s wrong , what you say , and I beg you , if you &apos;re a good man , to forget what you &apos;ve said , as I forget it , &quot; she said at last .
As the season is drawing to a close , I would beg you to return to Petersburg as quickly as possible , not later than Tuesday .
I don &apos;t understand , &quot; she said .
It was a roomy , old @-@ fashioned fly , with seats for four .
&quot; I am very glad of one thing , &quot; said Anna to Golenishtchev when they were on their way back , &quot; Alexey will have a capital _ atelier _ .
Anna ! &quot; he said with a choking voice , &quot; Anna , for pity &apos;s sake ! ... &quot; But the louder he spoke , the lower she dropped her once proud and gay , now shame @-@ stricken head , and she bowed down and sank from the sofa where she was sitting , down on the floor , at his feet ; she would have fallen on the carpet if he had not held her .
But for goodness &quot; sake don &apos;t suppose , &quot; her eyes added , &quot; that I would force my acquaintance on you , I simply admire you and like you . &quot; &quot; I like you too , and you &apos;re very , very sweet .
He felt that this was how it would be with his brother .
&quot; Wait a bit , when you set it to rights a little , you &apos;ll find it ! &quot; &quot; No ; if so , I should have felt a little , apart from my feeling &quot; ( he could not say love before them ) &quot; and happiness , a certain regret at losing my freedom .... On the contrary , I am glad at the very loss of my freedom . &quot; &quot; Awful !
&quot; Oh , moralist !
There remained only one filthy room , next to which they promised that another should be empty by the evening .
Most unpleasant of all was the first minute when , on coming , happy and good @-@ humored , from the theater , with a huge pear in his hand for his wife , he had not found his wife in the drawing @-@ room , to his surprise had not found her in the study either , and saw her at last in her bedroom with the unlucky letter that revealed everything in her hand .
You will intrust it to me ? &quot; Silently and gratefully Alexey Alexandrovitch pressed her hand .
At the time when the elder brother , with a mass of debts , married Princess Varya Tchirkova , the daughter of a Decembrist without any fortune whatever , Alexey had given up to his elder brother almost the whole income from his father &apos;s estate , reserving for himself only twenty @-@ five thousand a year from it .
Ryabinin &apos;s children will have means of livelihood and education , while yours maybe will not ! &quot; &quot; Well , you must excuse me , but there &apos;s something mean in this counting .
It seemed to each of them that the life he led himself was the only real life , and the life led by his friend was a mere phantasm .
The young man asked him for a light , and entered into conversation with him , and even pushed against him , to make him feel that he was not a thing , but a person .
&quot; A sledge , sir ? &quot; asked the porter .
He was pleased that there was still hope , and still more pleased that she should be suffering who had made him suffer so much .
He saw that the complex conditions of the life they led made the coarse proofs of his wife &apos;s guilt , required by the law , out of the question ; he saw that a certain refinement in that life would not admit of such proofs being brought forward , even if he had them , and that to bring forward such proofs would damage him in the public estimation more than it would her .
&quot; Excuse me , I did not know you , and , indeed , our acquaintance was so slight , &quot; said Vronsky , bowing , &quot; that no doubt you do not remember me . &quot; &quot; Oh , no , &quot; said she , &quot; I should have known you because your mother and I have been talking , I think , of nothing but you all the way . &quot; As she spoke she let the eagerness that would insist on coming out show itself in her smile .
The most unpleasant thing of all was that his pecuniary interests should in this way enter into the question of his reconciliation with his wife .
I &apos;ve been reconciling a husband with a man who &apos;d insulted his wife .
I always knew it and always saw it , though I tried to deceive myself to spare her , &quot; he said to himself .
Chapter 29 Everyone was loudly expressing disapprobation , everyone was repeating a phrase someone had uttered - &quot; The lions and gladiators will be the next thing , &quot; and everyone was feeling horrified ; so that when Vronsky fell to the ground , and Anna moaned aloud , there was nothing very out of the way in it .
And , yes , I do believe it &apos;s true what Darya Alexandrovna told me , &quot; he thought .
The views of the prince and of the princess on life abroad were completely opposed .
People coming in were still talking of what happened .
&quot; Get on , get on ! &quot; he said to the driver , putting his head out of the window , and pulling a three @-@ rouble note out of his pocket he handed it to the man as he looked round .
&quot; But how ?
Levin did not speak .
One of the clever people belonging to the set had called it &quot; the conscience of Petersburg society . &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch had the highest esteem for this circle , and Anna with her special gift for getting on with everyone , had in the early days of her life in Petersburg made friends in this circle also .
&quot; And nothing would induce him to come up .
Bitter as it was for the princess to see the unhappiness of her eldest daughter , Dolly , on the point of leaving her husband , her anxiety over the decision of her youngest daughter &apos;s fate engrossed all her feelings .
I often think that the celebrated talkers of the last century would have found it difficult to talk cleverly now .
Having filled a sheet of paper , he got up , rang , and sent a note to the chief secretary of his department to look up certain necessary facts for him .
&quot; You said a few words , but I can &apos;t answer in a few words , because ....
She understood it all , and without asking him , &quot; Is it this ? &quot; took the chalk and at once answered .
&quot; I would not offend you , &quot; his eyes seemed every time to be saying , &quot; but I want to save myself , and I don &apos;t know how . &quot; On his face was a look such as Kitty had never seen before .
When you understand that you will die tomorrow , if not today , and nothing will be left , then everything is so unimportant !
&quot; Eight thousand .
From the bedroom came the sound of Anna &apos;s voice saying something .
&quot; In a week &apos;s time .
Golenishtchev liked this direct and simple attitude to her own position .
He was writing now a new chapter on the causes of the present disastrous condition of agriculture in Russia .
But in what way this trouble of poverty and ignorance is to be cured by schools is as incomprehensible as how the hen @-@ roost affects the screaming .
But he had not time to write it down , for the head peasants had come round , and Levin went out into the hall to them .
Suppose I am taught , &quot; he went on musing , &quot; to shoot ; I press the trigger , &quot; he said to himself , closing his eyes , &quot; and it turns out I have killed him , &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself , and he shook his head as though to dispel such silly ideas .
&quot; I am weak .
Farther on , it was continually the same again and again : the same shaking and rattling , the same snow on the window , the same rapid transitions from steaming heat to cold , and back again to heat , the same passing glimpses of the same figures in the twilight , and the same voices , and Anna began to read and to understand what she read .
But what had he to be ashamed of ?
But there are ways and ways of flinging them . &quot; &quot; Yes , but what are her relations precisely with Kaluzhsky ? &quot; Betsy broke into unexpectedly mirthful and irrepressible laughter , a thing which rarely happened with her .
here it comes ! &quot; said Serpuhovskoy , laughing .
Come this way , please . &quot; Dolly &apos;s agitation had an effect on Alexey Alexandrovitch .
Levin sat down to wait till the professor should go , but he soon began to get interested in the subject under discussion .
Immediately after dinner Kitty came in .
The fat old Tatar , Madame Karenina &apos;s coachman , was with difficulty holding one of her pair of grays , chilled with the cold and rearing at the entrance .
the ball ! &quot; And the prince , imagining that he was mimicking his wife , made a mincing curtsey at each word .
It was annoying to come upon that everlasting slovenliness in the farm work against which he had been striving with all his might for so many years .
PART THREE Chapter 1 Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev wanted a rest from mental work , and instead of going abroad as he usually did , he came towards the end of May to stay in the country with his brother .
Listen , it &apos;s flying ! &quot; almost shrieked Levin , cocking his gun .
There was a merry chatter of peasant women over their linen at the pond , and the ring of axes in the yard , where the peasants were repairing ploughs and harrows .
it is .
All this happened , not because anyone felt ill @-@ will to Levin or his farm ; on the contrary , he knew that they liked him , thought him a simple gentleman ( their highest praise ) ; but it happened simply because all they wanted was to work merrily and carelessly , and his interests were not only remote and incomprehensible to them , but fatally opposed to their most just claims .
I &apos;ve an appointment there , all to do with my mission of peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; Blessed are the peacemakers ; theirs is the kingdom of heaven , &quot; &quot; said Betsy , vaguely recollecting she had heard some similar saying from someone .
To Sergey Ivanovitch the country meant on one hand rest from work , on the other a valuable antidote to the corrupt influences of town , which he took with satisfaction and a sense of its utility .
&quot; The theater , for instance , and the entertainments ... a - a - a ! &quot; he yawned .
&quot; I am afraid you &apos;ll be cold upstairs , &quot; observed Dolly , addressing Anna ; &quot; I want to move you downstairs , and we shall be nearer . &quot; &quot; Oh , please , don &apos;t trouble about me , &quot; answered Anna , looking intently into Dolly &apos;s face , trying to make out whether there had been a reconciliation or not .
This timidity touched Konstantin .
He has so much to do , and he has the faculty of interesting himself in everything .
His good humor was even greater when he saw Kitty completely recovered .
Catching sight of that smile , Dolly shuddered as though at physical pain , broke out with her characteristic heat into a flood of cruel words , and rushed out of the room .
When the softening effect of the near approach of death had passed away , Alexey Alexandrovitch began to notice that Anna was afraid of him , ill at ease with him , and could not look him straight in the face .
She would have to tell her mother she felt ill and go home , but she had not the strength to do this .
She felt all the justice of his words , and only said softly : &quot; You cannot describe my position as worse than I feel it to be myself ; but what are you saying all this for ? &quot; &quot; What am I saying it for ?
&quot; Two telegrams , &quot; said his manservant , coming into the room .
&quot; That it depended on you , &quot; he repeated .
what can I do ? ... &quot; she said , and burst into tears .
She was talking a long while with him .
Now she did not dress for her own sake , not for the sake of her own beauty , but simply that as the mother of those exquisite creatures she might not spoil the general effect .
She glanced towards the sofa beside her , and he instantly sat down .
&quot; He &apos;s to be pitied , he &apos;s weighed down by remorse .... &quot; &quot; Is he capable of remorse ? &quot; Dolly interrupted , gazing intently into her sister @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s face .
You know , tell me ! &quot; But Varenka did not even know what Kitty &apos;s eyes were asking her .
He was still in the hall when he caught the sound of her retreating footsteps .
I weaned her last carnival . &quot; &quot; How old is she ? &quot; &quot; Why , two years old . &quot; &quot; Why did you nurse her so long ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s our custom ; for three fasts .... &quot; And the conversation became most interesting to Darya Alexandrovna .
And are we fair in our judgment of brother Nikolay ?
All my old dreams of home life were absurd , not the real thing , &quot; he told himself .
&quot; I told you it was mother ! &quot; he shouted to the governess .
A long time more he sat over him so , continually expecting the end .
He was convinced he could fly upwards or lift the corner of the house , if need be .
The prince had spread out near him his purchases , carved boxes , and knick @-@ knacks , paper @-@ knives of all sorts , of which he bought a heap at every watering @-@ place , and bestowed them upon everyone , including Lieschen , the servant girl , and the landlord , with whom he jested in his comically bad German , assuring him that it was not the water had cured Kitty , but his splendid cookery , especially his plum soup .
Levin crimsoned both from shame and anger with his wife , who had put herself and him in such a difficult position ; but Marya Nikolaevna crimsoned still more .
Stepan Arkadyevitch was smiling and beckoning to his brother @-@ in @-@ law .
There , do you see , you know the type of Ossian &apos;s women .... Women , such as one sees in dreams .... Well , these women are sometimes to be met in reality ... and these women are terrible .
&quot; Warn me ? &quot; she said .
But have you really been mowing the whole day ?
What had become of his always self @-@ possessed resolute manner , and the carelessly serene expression of his face ?
&quot; Mademoiselle Varenka ? &quot; asked Kitty .
Getting up and walking about the room , he glanced again at the portrait , frowned , and smiled contemptuously .
The day after their arrival there was a heavy fall of rain , and in the night the water came through in the corridor and in the nursery , so that the beds had to be carried into the drawing @-@ room .
She was studying his face to make up for the time she had not seen him .
Please , don &apos;t talk of it ! &quot; &quot; But who can have told you so ?
She says you &apos;re a real heroine of romance , and that if she were a man she would do all sorts of mad things for your sake .
Everything was straight and clear , just as after former days of reckoning .
What hay it &apos;ll be ! &quot; said an old man , squatting down beside Levin .
The gentleman with the gray whiskers was obviously an inveterate adherent of serfdom and a devoted agriculturist , who had lived all his life in the country .
The new frocks were taken off , and orders were given for the little girls to have their blouses put on , and the boys their old jackets , and the wagonette to be harnessed ; with Brownie , to the bailiff &apos;s annoyance , again in the shafts , to drive out for mushroom picking and bathing .
But that feeling had been replaced by another , the desire , not merely that she should not be triumphant , but that she should get due punishment for her crime .
&quot; No , no , she cannot forgive me , &quot; he keeps saying . &quot; Dolly looked dreamily away beyond her sister @-@ in @-@ law as she listened to her words .
The prince withdrew , trying not to show how ridiculous he thought the whole performance .
&quot; Yes , yes .... &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , not able to answer for the tears that were choking him .
That &apos;s much the same as - not merely carrying the _ fardeau _ in your arms - but tearing it away from someone else . &quot; &quot; You have never loved , &quot; Vronsky said softly , looking straight before him and thinking of Anna .
How is it you can &apos;t understand that a woman can never forget that , &quot; she said , getting more and more angry , and so letting him see the cause of her irritation , &quot; especially a woman who cannot know your life ?
Alexey Alexandrovitch , a man of great power in the world of politics , felt himself helpless in this .
Whether with her , or with another , still it would be .
&quot; It &apos;s not those peasants but this bailiff ! &quot; said Levin , getting angry .
Did I tell you not to ? &quot; said her mother .
&quot; What is the matter with you today ? &quot; &quot; With me ?
You &apos;re still at the same work , then ? &quot; he went on , recalling that he had been told Golenishtchev was writing something .
What do you think , Alexander ? &quot; &quot; Here he is , &quot; said the old prince , pointing to Levin - &quot; he &apos;s the principal person in the matter . &quot; &quot; When ? &quot; said Levin blushing .
But this simple incident for some reason struck everyone as strange .
He thought of nothing but that he would see her directly , not in imagination , but living , all of her , as she was in reality .
His work is with the mind .... &quot; &quot; Maybe .
She felt for him with her whole heart , the more because she was pitying him for suffering of which she was herself the cause .
But as though of set design , each time she was softened she began to speak again of what exasperated her .
I &apos;ve come to meet a pretty woman , &quot; said Oblonsky .
Chapter 19 On the day of the races at Krasnoe Selo , Vronsky had come earlier than usual to eat beefsteak in the common messroom of the regiment .
When Anna returned with the album , he was already gone , and Stepan Arkadyevitch was telling them that he had called to inquire about the dinner they were giving next day to a celebrity who had just arrived .
&quot; Took the sacrament and all . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not what I mean , &quot; said he .
He had hitherto taken up a cold and even antagonistic attitude to this new doctrine , and with Countess Lidia Ivanovna , who had been carried away by it , he had never argued , but by silence had assiduously parried her attempts to provoke him into argument .
&quot; Very ill ?
&quot; I know : one must find out what he is arguing for , what is precious to him , then one can .... &quot; She had completely guessed and expressed his badly expressed idea .
Oblonsky seemed to ponder .
Alexey Vronsky is the soul of honor , and he is going away to Tashkend . &quot; &quot; Thank you , princess , for your sympathy and advice .
There he goes ! &quot; he added , listening to the roar of &quot; hurrah ! &quot; - &quot; and he &apos;s happy , but that does not satisfy you . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say it did satisfy me . &quot; &quot; Yes , but that &apos;s not the only thing .
Grisha and Tanya had been fighting over a ball .
Win anything ? &quot; asked Vronsky .
How do you mean ?
&quot; All I want is to regulate labor . &quot; &quot; Which means , you &apos;ve borrowed an idea , stripped it of all that gave it its force , and want to make believe that it &apos;s something new , &quot; said Nikolay , angrily tugging at his necktie .
&quot; Yes ; but I can &apos;t help it .
On the 30th of September the sun came out in the morning , and hoping for fine weather , Levin began making final preparations for his journey .
In God &apos;s name .
I think that for educated people , &quot; said Mihailov , &quot; the question cannot exist . &quot; Golenishtchev did not agree with this , and confounded Mihailov by his support of his first idea of the unity of the impression being essential to art .
The news of Kitty &apos;s friendship with Madame Stahl and Varenka , and the reports the princess gave him of some kind of change she had noticed in Kitty , troubled the prince and aroused his habitual feeling of jealousy of everything that drew his daughter away from him , and a dread that his daughter might have got out of the reach of his influence into regions inaccessible to him .
It &apos;s all the better for me if the peasants do their work better . &quot; &quot; Well , whatever you do , if he &apos;s a lazy good @-@ for @-@ nought , everything &apos;ll be at sixes and sevens .
I traveled yesterday with Vronsky &apos;s mother , &quot; she went on ; &quot; and his mother talked without a pause of him , he &apos;s her favorite .
And in consequence of this , Vronsky , who had been in the habit of living on the scale of forty @-@ five thousand a year , having only received twenty thousand that year , found himself now in difficulties .
She saw her now as someone quite new and surprising to her .
He went up to them .
&quot; Wait a minute , &quot; he said , sitting down to the table .
He was angry with everyone , and said nasty things to everyone , reproached everyone for his sufferings , and insisted that they should get him a celebrated doctor from Moscow .
And another thing , women are all more materialistic than men .
What have I to strive and toil for ?
In Europe , a rational system answers because the people are educated ; it follows that we must educate the people - that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; But how are we to educate the people ? &quot; &quot; To educate the people three things are needed : schools , and schools , and schools .
She is not a judge , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , recovering himself .
On the contrary , he felt that Sviazhsky was right , that the whole business was of little value , and he saw the wonderful softness and consideration with which Sviazhsky avoided fully expressing his correct view .
The very next morning he began to be irritable , and seemed doing his best to find fault with his brother , attacking him on his tenderest points .
I &apos;m never happy except with the children at your house . &quot; &quot; What a pity you can &apos;t be with me ! &quot; &quot; Oh , yes , I &apos;m coming .
He was himself unconscious how , as he approached them , he seized on this impression and absorbed it , as he had the chin of the shopkeeper who had sold him the cigars , and put it away somewhere to be brought out when he wanted it .
That will be a lie .
The French fashion - of the parents arranging their children &apos;s future - was not accepted ; it was condemned .
They would have felt it wounding themselves to deceive the child .
In his judgment the best sort of life was a country life .
Chapter 18 Vronsky followed the guard to the carriage , and at the door of the compartment he stopped short to make room for a lady who was getting out .
&quot; So you won &apos;t come to see us , then , when Kitty &apos;s here ? &quot; &quot; No , I shan &apos;t come .
It all happened at the same time : a boy ran towards a dove and glanced smiling at Levin ; the dove , with a whir of her wings , darted away , flashing in the sun , amid grains of snow that quivered in the air , while from a little window there came a smell of fresh @-@ baked bread , and the loaves were put out .
One impression pursued her relentlessly .
&quot; I ?
But it was impossible to draw back .
You shall not see me if my presence is distasteful to you . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to drive you away . &quot; &quot; Only don &apos;t change anything , leave everything as it is , &quot; he said in a shaky voice .
But still this first period of their married life was a difficult time for them .
His mother , a dried @-@ up old lady with black eyes and ringlets , screwed up her eyes , scanning her son , and smiled slightly with her thin lips .
He did not sleep all night .
Why , acquitted them .
But till then he had had nothing to do with the law courts , and so had disapproved of their publicity simply in theory ; now his disapprobation was strengthened by the unpleasant impression made on him in the lawyer &apos;s waiting room .
Now she understood that Anna could not have been in lilac , and that her charm was just that she always stood out against her attire , that her dress could never be noticeable on her .
&quot; Well , there &apos;s no help for it , I must confess .
&quot; Does he know , or doesn &apos;t he , that I did make an offer ? &quot; Levin wondered , gazing at him .
He too was silent for some time , and then began speaking in a frigid , less shrill voice , emphasizing random words that had no special significance .
But Levin , scowling , made as though he did not notice his hand , and took out the snipe .
His father &apos;s immense property , which alone yielded a yearly income of two hundred thousand , was left undivided between the brothers .
At every turn he had scenes with the princess for compromising her daughter .
&quot; He asked her for the mazurka before me , &quot; said Countess Nordston , knowing Kitty would understand who were &quot; he &quot; and &quot; her . &quot; &quot; She said : &quot; Why , aren &apos;t you going to dance it with Princess Shtcherbatskaya ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , I don &apos;t care ! &quot; answered Kitty .
On catching sight of their mother they were dismayed , but , looking into her face , they saw they were not doing wrong .
&quot; If you can , lead the race ; but don &apos;t lose heart till the last minute , even if you &apos;re behind . &quot; Before the mare had time to move , Vronsky stepped with an agile , vigorous movement into the steel @-@ toothed stirrup , and lightly and firmly seated himself on the creaking leather of the saddle .
Clutching at his arm , she nodded smiling to Levin .
You must certainly take that room , &quot; she said to Vronsky in Russian , using the affectionately familiar form as though she saw that Golenishtchev would become intimate with them in their isolation , and that there was no need of reserve before him .
On the tenth day from their arrival at the town , Kitty was unwell .
Come , isn &apos;t it true that you &apos;re a savage ?
A gem !
&quot; Of course I shall say Betsy has sent me to ask whether she &apos;s coming to the races .
An acquaintance met him and called him by his name , but Levin did not even recognize him .
&quot; But I should be in despair if there were anything serious in it on his side , &quot; Anna interrupted her .
Seeing the master , the laborer , Vassily , went towards the cart , while Mishka set to work sowing .
Ryabinin was a tall , thinnish , middle @-@ aged man , with mustache and a projecting clean @-@ shaven chin , and prominent muddy @-@ looking eyes .
He thought no more of the shower spoiling the race course , but was rejoicing now that - thanks to the rain - he would be sure to find her at home and alone , as he knew that Alexey Alexandrovitch , who had lately returned from a foreign watering place , had not moved from Petersburg .
Why such a conquering hero ? &quot; he thought .
Why didn &apos;t I ask him !
My hands were suddenly set free .
Levin , rejecting the roll , put on his coat and went out again for a walk .
Still you may do as you like .... &quot; And turning away so that his brother @-@ in @-@ law could not see him , he sat down on a chair at the window .
&quot; She &apos;s a nice girl &quot; were such simple , humble words , so out of harmony with his feeling .
She flushed , bent down slightly , and put her cheek to the countess &apos;s lips , drew herself up again , and with the same smile fluttering between her lips and her eyes , she gave her hand to Vronsky .
If it had not been a characteristic of Levin &apos;s to put the most favorable interpretation on people , Sviazhsky &apos;s character would have presented no doubt or difficulty to him : he would have said to himself , &quot; a fool or a knave , &quot; and everything would have seemed clear .
Vronsky was a squarely built , dark man , not very tall , with a good @-@ humored , handsome , and exceedingly calm and resolute face .
His most usual and natural listener was his brother .
She was afraid that her daughter , who had at one time , as she fancied , a feeling for Levin , might , from extreme sense of honor , refuse Vronsky , and that Levin &apos;s arrival might generally complicate and delay the affair so near being concluded .
&quot; Still no better ? &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch .
&quot; What an inclination we all have , though , for these cruel spectacles , &quot; he said .
If I say that - I ought to be prepared to do it , that is , I ought to have the money and to retire from the army . &quot; And he grew thoughtful .
&quot; You say that all should be as it is .
&quot; I &apos;m alone , and expecting Seryozha ; he &apos;s out for a walk ; they &apos;ll come in from this side . &quot; But , in spite of her efforts to be calm , her lips were quivering .
The whole evening Dolly was , as always , a little mocking in her tone to her husband , while Stepan Arkadyevitch was happy and cheerful , but not so as to seem as though , having been forgiven , he had forgotten his offense .
Most likely he was sending a note to say so .
Konstantin Levin sighed , looking meanwhile about the cheerless and dirty room .
I have done wrong , and so I don &apos;t want happiness , I don &apos;t want a divorce , and shall suffer from my shame and the separation from my child . &quot; But , however sincerely Anna had meant to suffer , she was not suffering .
But the peasants were carrying the oats in spades when they might simply let them slide down into the lower granary ; and arranging for this to be done , and taking two workmen from there for sowing clover , Levin got over his vexation with the bailiff .
why not ?
He drove home thinking of nothing but her , of her love , of his own happiness , and the nearer he drew to home , the warmer was his tenderness for her .
&quot; Yes , it is true , it is true ... now ! &quot; Vronsky added , to be truthful .
&quot; Come , you &apos;d better let philosophy alone , &quot; he said .
You married a man twenty years older than yourself .
all the same , &quot; said Levin , &quot; when with loathing I go over my life , I shudder and curse and bitterly regret it .... Yes . &quot; &quot; What would you have ?
No one , neither his brother nor Kitty , could soothe him .
And the professor had promptly appeared to argue the matter out .
He smiled contemptuously , and flung down the telegram .
The baby was lying with its head thrown back , stiffening itself in the nurse &apos;s arms , and would not take the plump breast offered it ; and it never ceased screaming in spite of the double hushing of the wet @-@ nurse and the other nurse , who was bending over her .
&quot; Why don &apos;t you go up to him ?
&quot; Wait a little . &quot; He was silent .
It &apos;s really ludicrous ; her object is doing good ; she a Christian , yet she &apos;s always angry ; and she always has enemies , and always enemies in the name of Christianity and doing good . &quot; After Countess Lidia Ivanovna another friend came , the wife of a chief secretary , who told her all the news of the town .
The doctor brought by Levin , and found by him at the club , was not the one who had been attending Nikolay Levin , as the patient was dissatisfied with him .
&quot; His being such a perfect aristocrat , don &apos;t you know , and his future position in society , had an influence not with her , but with her mother . &quot; Levin scowled .
And how do I know whether you tell me the truth ? ... &quot; &quot; Anna , you hurt me .
But do sit down . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mind if I do , &quot; said Ryabinin , sitting down and leaning his elbows on the back of his chair in a position of the intensest discomfort to himself .
At the time he left the university he was fond of science , took an interest in humanity ; now one @-@ half of his abilities is devoted to deceiving himself , and the other to justifying the deceit . &quot; &quot; A more determined enemy of matrimony than you I never saw , &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch .
And she was at once aware that Levin was aware of this .
&quot; We must ask about another room , &quot; she said to her husband , &quot; so that we might be nearer . &quot; Chapter 18 Levin could not look calmly at his brother ; he could not himself be natural and calm in his presence .
I won &apos;t conceal from you that in beginning this I was in uncertainty , I was in misery ; I will confess that I was pursued by a desire to revenge myself on you and on her .
&quot; Yes , it &apos;s time , &quot; he said .
This is essential for me , for you , and for our son .
He smiled , while she laughed gaily , with that sweet , deep laugh , which was one of her greatest charms .
&quot; Well , let &apos;s go into my room , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , who knew his friend &apos;s sensitive and irritable shyness , and , taking his arm , he drew him along , as though guiding him through dangers .
Do I try and catch them ?
&quot; Who is here ? &quot; asked Alexey Alexandrovitch .
&quot; Now let us be off , &quot; said Vronsky , coming in .
&quot; Been here long , my boy ?
She was the more aware of this from noticing in the inquisitive look Mihail Vassilievitch turned on her that he was , as it were , keeping watch on her .
I have had a dream . &quot; &quot; A dream ? &quot; repeated Vronsky , and instantly he recalled the peasant of his dream .
&quot; Oh , if you had seen it , countess , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch .
For a long while he could say nothing , not so much because he was afraid of desecrating the loftiness of his emotion by a word , as that every time he tried to say something , instead of words he felt that tears of happiness were welling up .
But can it be true that you are resolved on a divorce ? &quot; &quot; I am resolved on extreme measures .
This conversation had partly reassured the princess ; but perfectly at ease she could not be .
All the members of that family , especially the feminine half , were pictured by him , as it were , wrapped about with a mysterious poetical veil , and he not only perceived no defects whatever in them , but under the poetical veil that shrouded them he assumed the existence of the loftiest sentiments and every possible perfection .
She nodded .
His eyes were clear , not feverish ; but their expression was stern .
&quot; The grass says to the water : we quiver and we quiver . &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know the riddle , &quot; answered Levin wearily .
What can you love me for ? &quot; &quot; My God !
&quot; Whether she &apos;s coming or not , I don &apos;t care , &quot; he said to himself .
my God , how I loved him ! ...
&quot; I &apos;m just as happy .
Long before , Levin had felt dissatisfaction with his own position in regard to the land .
You despise public official work because you want the reality to be invariably corresponding all the while with the aim - and that &apos;s not how it is .
The sun sank behind the forest .
&quot; Yes , it was nice , very nice .
She at once began talking to him with French exaggerated politeness , applauding him for having such a delightful daughter , extolling Kitty to the skies before her face , and calling her a treasure , a pearl , and a consoling angel .
Cupboards and chests were open ; twice they had sent to the shop for cord ; pieces of newspaper were tossing about on the floor .
&quot; There , you see , you &apos;re talking nonsense , and he &apos;s at home ! &quot; responded Stepan Arkadyevitch &apos;s voice , addressing the servant , who had refused to let him in , and taking off his coat as he went , Oblonsky walked into the room .
She was still drawing with the chalk on the table .
But now , when he began to think over the question that had just presented itself , it seemed to him very complicated and difficult .
You don &apos;t know what I have suffered waiting for you .
She told him about herself even and about her wedding , and smiled and sympathized with him and petted him , and talked of cases of recovery and all went well ; so then she must know .
&quot; You don &apos;t say so ! &quot; &quot; _ Honi soit qui mal y pense ! _ My sister Anna . &quot; &quot; Ah !
She felt sure she would dance the mazurka with him as she had done at former balls , and refused five young men , saying she was engaged for the mazurka .
Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled contemptuously .
Here a Polish speculator bought for half its value a magnificent estate from a young lady who lives in Nice .
Above all , he feared the patient would be angry at it .
Of course , it &apos;s not her fault .
&quot; Why , am I not so nice as she ? &quot; asked Seryozha .
But how marriages were made now , the princess could not learn from anyone .
&quot; But express what - what decision ? &quot; he said to himself in the drawing @-@ room , and he found no reply .
This is how I should like to live ! &quot; &quot; Why , who prevents you ? &quot; said Levin , smiling .
In all Petersburg there was not a human being to whom he could express what he was feeling , who would feel for him , not as a high official , not as a member of society , but simply as a suffering man ; indeed he had not such a one in the whole world .
She knew their relations with one another and with the head authorities , knew who was for whom , and how each one maintained his position , and where they agreed and disagreed .
&quot; But you must , really , Dolly .... &quot; &quot; Go away , go away , go away ! &quot; she shrieked , not looking at him , as though this shriek were called up by physical pain .
Two of the members of the board , the old veteran in the service , Nikitin , and the _ Kammerjunker _ Grinevitch , went in with him .
But , in spite of that , the mother had spent the whole of that winter in a state of terrible anxiety and agitation .
These were the only words that had been spoken sincerely between them .
Come round tomorrow with the locksmith . &quot; Kritsky had hardly gone out when Nikolay Levin smiled and winked .
&quot; Let it be !
He , too , felt suddenly good @-@ humored and disinclined to leave his brother &apos;s side .
&quot; Is he aiming at doing anything , or simply undoing what &apos;s been done ?
This self @-@ deception was not of long duration .
All these ways of his she knew , and all were hateful to her .
All the officials sitting on the further side under the portrait of the Tsar and the eagle , delighted at any distraction , looked round at the door ; but the doorkeeper standing at the door at once drove out the intruder , and closed the glass door after him .
I never thought of it . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re a pretty fellow ! &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch laughing , &quot; and you call me a Nihilist !
They &apos;ll miss it , &quot; thought Laska .
The sop was so good that Levin gave up the idea of going home .
And immediately he recollected his brother Nikolay and how hateful he was to have been able to forget him .
Konstantin Dmitrievitch , my respects &quot; ; he turned to Levin , trying to seize his hand too .
She walked across the room , and her ringlets and her face were beaming .
He doesn &apos;t even comprehend how good it is .
On getting home that day , Levin had a delightful sense of relief at the awkward position being over and having been got through without his having to tell a lie .
Besides , the sister @-@ in @-@ law with her low @-@ necked bodice aroused in him a feeling akin to shame and remorse for some utterly base action .
His brother seated himself under a bush , arranging his tackle , while Levin led the horse away , fastened him up , and walked into the vast gray @-@ green sea of grass unstirred by the wind .
A look of fear crossed his face , but he regained his serenity immediately .
Now every time he turned to her , he bent his head , as though he would have fallen at her feet , and in his eyes there was nothing but humble submission and dread .
&quot; Another present for my old woman , &quot; he said as he did so .
He listened to her hard , heavy breathing , and he was unutterably sorry for her .
&quot; What makes you think so ? &quot; he asked , stopping short .
I see a man who has serious intentions , that &apos;s Levin : and I see a peacock , like this feather @-@ head , who &apos;s only amusing himself . &quot; &quot; Oh , well , when once you get an idea into your head ! ... &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;ll remember my words , but too late , just as with Dolly . &quot; &quot; Well , well , we won &apos;t talk of it , &quot; the princess stopped him , recollecting her unlucky Dolly .
And kissing Kitty once more , without saying what was important , she stepped out courageously with the music under her arm and vanished into the twilight of the summer night , bearing away with her her secret of what was important and what gave her the calm and dignity so much to be envied .
&quot; You will go to see her ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
In practice the system worked capitally , or , at least , so it seemed to Levin .
When he was present , both Vronsky and Anna did not merely avoid speaking of anything that they could not have repeated before everyone ; they did not even allow themselves to refer by hints to anything the boy did not understand .
&quot; Well , well ? &quot; she said , coming into the drawing @-@ room , without taking off her hat .
&quot; Kostya , what &apos;s the matter ? &quot; she asked , definitely adopting this familiar name as soon as the maid had gone out .
I say socialism : worse .
On getting back from the sick @-@ room to their own two rooms for the night , Levin sat with hanging head not knowing what to do .
&quot; Bad luck to your tongue ! &quot; said Princess Myakaya suddenly .
He stood on the steps of the Karenins &quot; house like one distraught , and did not know what to do .
There was only one stage in the transition from coldness to inspiration , at which work was possible .
But now he could deceive himself no longer .
As for the baroness , he was sick to death of her , especially since she &apos;d taken to offering continually to lend him money .
&quot; I know more of the world than you do , &quot; she said .
But that he only knew much later .
He went straight from the cowhouse to the counting house , and after a little conversation with the bailiff and Semyon the contractor , he went back to the house and straight upstairs to the drawing @-@ room .
Vronsky , who was , as it were , chief master of the ceremonies to him , was at great pains to arrange all the Russian amusements suggested by various persons to the prince .
And I shall find it , &quot; he said to himself , frowning more and more .
After standing a moment in silence , he said : &quot; From your words I may consequently conclude that a divorce may be obtained ?
As it was , even in the course of these three days , the youngest was unwell from being given unwholesome soup , and the others had almost gone without their dinner the day before .
Not like some of us . &quot; &quot; You have a great deal to complain of , haven &apos;t you , Stepan Arkadyevitch ? &quot; &quot; Ah , yes , I &apos;m in a poor way , a bad way , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a heavy sigh .
Shame there was not .
&quot; Throw up everything , she and I , and hide ourselves somewhere alone with our love , &quot; he said to himself .
&quot; I drove here with Vaska .... Ah , to be sure , you don &apos;t know each other . &quot; And mentioning his surname she introduced the young man , and reddening a little , broke into a ringing laugh at her mistake - that is , at her having called him Vaska to a stranger .
Though a good deal is not true that you say about Vronsky , but I won &apos;t talk about that .
Why , you live in the liveliest set in Petersburg , &quot; said Anna .
&quot; He &apos;s going away , &quot; answered Varenka .
&quot; It &apos;s not the loss of what I have not now , it &apos;s not that ! &quot; pursued Alexey Alexandrovitch .
The doctors said that it was puerperal fever , and that it was ninety @-@ nine chances in a hundred it would end in death .
Chapter 2 Early in June it happened that Agafea Mihalovna , the old nurse and housekeeper , in carrying to the cellar a jar of mushrooms she had just pickled , slipped , fell , and sprained her wrist .
Levin looked at Kitty , and he had never before seen her look as she did .
May I ? &quot; &quot; What for ?
&quot; How exquisite it all is in this exquisite night !
Nothing but the stern discipline of her bringing @-@ up supported her and forced her to do what was expected of her , that is , to dance , to answer questions , to talk , even to smile .
so hateful !
No one knew what her faith was - Catholic , Protestant , or Orthodox .
&quot; You know her , no doubt ? &quot; &quot; I think I do .
I believe you , I believe you .... What were you saying ? &quot; But he could not at once recall what he had been going to say .
And Levin saw that Yegor too was in an excited state and intending to express all his most heartfelt emotions .
&quot; It &apos;s true that it &apos;s high time I was dead ; and that all this is nonsense .
&quot; No , no ! &quot; she began .
The elegant , whiskered manservant , who used to be continually complaining to his acquaintances of the delicacy of his nerves , was so panic @-@ stricken on seeing his master lying on the floor , that he left him losing blood while he ran for assistance .
In the new public law courts he disliked the restrictions laid on the lawyers conducting cases .
&quot; How happy we are alone together ! - I am , that is , &quot; he said , going up to her with a radiant smile of happiness .
I told him : when the members come out , then .... &quot; &quot; Where is he ? &quot; &quot; Maybe he &apos;s gone into the passage , but here he comes anyway .
Kitty was looking at the door , calling up all her energies to keep her from blushing at the entrance of Konstantin Levin .
Putting a cup before Anna , she took out a cigarette , and , fitting it into a silver holder , she lighted it .
&quot; Come , if only as a study in morals .
I &apos;ll go to Betsy &apos;s , perhaps I shall see him there , &quot; she said to herself , completely forgetting that when she had told him the day before that she was not going to Princess Tverskaya &apos;s , he had said that in that case he should not go either .
In the society in which she lived such plain statements produced the effect of the wittiest epigram .
In a moment he had so kneaded together the social dough that the drawing @-@ room became very lively , and there was a merry buzz of voices .
What she was saying was too important to her .
His head was heavy .
He &apos;s such a remarkable man , &quot; said the ambassador &apos;s wife .
&quot; Yes , but altogether ; altogether . &quot; &quot; But how , Alexey , tell me how ? &quot; she said in melancholy mockery at the hopelessness of her own position .
&quot; Anna is quite changed since her stay in Moscow .
Whatever our destiny is or may be , we have made it ourselves , and we do not complain of it , &quot; he said , in the word _ we _ linking himself with Anna .
&quot; I advise you to get the bouquets from Fomin &apos;s . &quot; &quot; Oh , are they wanted ? &quot; And he drove to Fomin &apos;s .
Her adoration of him alarmed her indeed ; she sought and could not find in him anything not fine .
&quot; _ Il ne faut jamais rien outrer _ , &quot; she said to her .
Never had the impossibility of his position in the world &apos;s eyes , and his wife &apos;s hatred of him , and altogether the might of that mysterious brutal force that guided his life against his spiritual inclinations , and exacted conformity with its decrees and change in his attitude to his wife , been presented to him with such distinctness as that day .
The tears stood in her eyes , and she could not have spoken without crying .
No one would believe it , but it came to pass .
Do you know why I &apos;m going today instead of tomorrow ?
If she were to read this letter , she would be incapable of saying anything , she would only hang her head lower than ever . &quot; &quot; Yes , but what &apos;s to be done in that case ?
All the awfulness of the storm seemed to her more splendid now .
Champagne , &quot; said Levin .
I was born a Bohemian , and a Bohemian I shall die . &quot; &quot; So much the better , so much the better .
He was stupefied with happiness .
&quot; You won &apos;t help matters like this , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a smile , hurrying with more deliberation after him .
&quot; I know why you press me to come to the ball .
But when early in the winter of this year Levin came to Moscow , after a year in the country , and saw the Shtcherbatskys , he realized which of the three sisters he was indeed destined to love .
He , so manly a man , never opposed her , had indeed , with her , no will of his own , and was anxious , it seemed , for nothing but to anticipate her wishes .
There was nothing in the sky in the least like a shell .
&quot; There &apos;s only one point to be considered : is either of the parties desirous of forming new ties ?
And how aloof and remote from him she had become now !
&quot; Do you know why Kitty didn &apos;t come to dinner ?
&quot; There &apos;s no one to send .
There had been in his past , as in every man &apos;s , actions , recognized by him as bad , for which his conscience ought to have tormented him ; but the memory of these evil actions was far from causing him so much suffering as those trivial but humiliating reminiscences .
The arguments and the division of the haycocks lasted the whole afternoon .
Is it possible he will not feel for me ? &quot; Tears were already flowing down her face , and to hide them she got up abruptly and almost ran out on to the terrace .
Turning again to the lectern , the priest with some difficulty took Kitty &apos;s little ring , and asking Levin for his hand , put it on the first joint of his finger .
&quot; In short , I don &apos;t wish it .... &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch advanced and would have taken her hand .
&quot; No , she hates me .
He told his brother of his plans and his doings .
A distant part of the estate , a tract of waste land that had lain fallow for eight years , was with the help of the clever carpenter , Fyodor Ryezunov , taken by six families of peasants on new conditions of partnership , and the peasant Shuraev took the management of all the vegetable gardens on the same terms .
His connection with Madame Karenina , by creating so much sensation and attracting general attention , had given him a fresh distinction which soothed his gnawing worm of ambition for a while , but a week before that worm had been roused up again with fresh force .
I feel I &apos;m lying head downwards in a sort of pit , but I ought not to save myself .
&quot; But what &apos;s to be done ? &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t steal rolls . &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed outright .
He expected all this ; he saw it all in their faces , he saw it in the careless indifference with which they talked among themselves , stared at the lay figures and busts , and walked about in leisurely fashion , waiting for him to uncover his picture .
All at once he smiled and gesticulated gleefully .
Princess Tverskaya was walking with Tushkevitch and a young lady , a relation , who , to the great joy of her parents in the provinces , was spending the summer with the fashionable princess .
In Moscow he had for the first time felt , after his luxurious and coarse life at Petersburg , all the charm of intimacy with a sweet and innocent girl of his own rank , who cared for him .
The ignorant peasant @-@ women starve the children , and the people stagnate in darkness , and are helpless in the hands of every village clerk , while you have at your disposal a means of helping them , and don &apos;t help them because to your mind it &apos;s of no importance . &quot; And Sergey Ivanovitch put before him the alternative : either you are so undeveloped that you can &apos;t see all that you can do , or you won &apos;t sacrifice your ease , your vanity , or whatever it is , to do it .
What do I know ?
&quot; That &apos;s as it happens .
A long while she lay , not moving , with open eyes , whose brilliance she almost fancied she could herself see in the darkness .
&quot; But it &apos;s over now ?
By gymnastics and careful attention to his health he had brought himself to such a point that in spite of his excess in pleasure he looked as fresh as a big glossy green Dutch cucumber .
&quot; Not at all .
His love for her , of which she felt certain , was flattering and delightful to her ; and it was pleasant for her to think of Levin .
A stable boy , spruce and smart in his holiday attire , met them with a broom in his hand , and followed them .
Why did you find it so tiresome ? &quot; &quot; Oh , it was intolerable ! &quot; he said , trying to pick up the thread of his interrupted thought .
The ladies got in , while Vronsky and Stepan Arkadyevitch followed the crowd to find out details of the disaster .
Mihail Vassilievitch , you &apos;ve not been to see me before .
And for him , living in a certain society - owing to the need , ordinarily developed at years of discretion , for some degree of mental activity - to have views was just as indispensable as to have a hat .
&quot; Aha !
Her relations with Stepan Arkadyevitch after their reconciliation had become humiliating .
Having finished the paper , a second cup of coffee and a roll and butter , he got up , shaking the crumbs of the roll off his waistcoat ; and , squaring his broad chest , he smiled joyously : not because there was anything particularly agreeable in his mind - the joyous smile was evoked by a good digestion .
You know we &apos;re hoping he will marry Kitty . &quot; &quot; Yes ? &quot; said Anna softly .
&quot; You lay too much stress on your devotion for me to value it much , &quot; she responded in the same jesting tone , involuntarily listening to the sound of Vronsky &apos;s steps behind them .
Only , why did he say that ? ... &quot; she mused .
&quot; Take the money ; it &apos;s my forest .
But after him another friendly greeting brought Vronsky to a standstill .
Why would they try to cure her with pills and powders ?
And that &apos;s rather droll , as they didn &apos;t get on together . &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s that ?
But I tell you what ; if you want to see them , they &apos;re sure now to be at the Zoological Gardens from four to five .
The steward did not take up much time .
&quot; How is it you don &apos;t smoke ?
Vronsky went into the hall .
The wooden plough too wasn &apos;t always used .
And _ your _ cheese , your excellency ? &quot; &quot; Oh , yes , Parmesan .
Now , as he talked to his brother of a matter bound to be exceedingly disagreeable to him , knowing that the eyes of many people might be fixed upon him , he kept a smiling countenance , as though he were jesting with his brother about something of little moment .
Good news , then ? &quot; They tried to tell her what the doctor had said , but it appeared that though the doctor had talked distinctly enough and at great length , it was utterly impossible to report what he had said .
The proof that they knew for a certainty the nature of death lay in the fact that they knew without a second of hesitation how to deal with the dying , and were not frightened of them .
The Countess Lidia Ivanovna was a tall , stout woman , with an unhealthily sallow face and splendid , pensive black eyes .
At Petersburg , as soon as the train stopped and she got out , the first person that attracted her attention was her husband .
&quot; What have I to be ashamed of ? &quot; she asked herself in injured surprise .
The princess asked Varenka to sing again , and Varenka sang another song , also smoothly , distinctly , and well , standing erect at the piano and beating time on it with her thin , dark @-@ skinned hand .
All the thoughts and feelings he had passed through fell into three separate trains of thought .
The smile died away from his face , and he grew thoughtful .
why do his ears look like that ? &quot; she thought , looking at his frigid and imposing figure , and especially the ears that struck her at the moment as propping up the brim of his round hat .
He saw a well @-@ painted ( no , not even that - he distinctly saw now a mass of defects ) repetition of those endless Christs of Titian , Raphael , Rubens , and the same soldiers and Pilate .
&quot; How nice he is , your father ! &quot; Kitty did not speak .
The devil has great power , and we must resist him .
&quot; Dolly , how glad I am to see you ! &quot; &quot; I am glad , too , &quot; said Dolly , faintly smiling , and trying by the expression of Anna &apos;s face to find out whether she knew .
Dolly , Tchirikov , and Stepan Arkadyevitch stepped forward to set them right .
Ah , the thoughts that come crowding on one !
And do you know why ?
Hurrah ! &quot; The colonel was followed by Serpuhovskoy , who came out onto the steps smiling , with a glass in his hand .
&quot; It was an amusing meeting . &quot; And he began telling with droll good @-@ humor how , after not sleeping all night , he had , wearing an old fur @-@ lined , full @-@ skirted coat , got into Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s compartment .
&quot; I see , of course .... &quot; But at that instant Kritsky , at the door , called him .... &quot; What do you want now ? &quot; he said , and went out to him in the passage .
In front of him , in the bend of the river beyond the marsh , moved a bright @-@ colored line of peasant women , and the scattered hay was being rapidly formed into gray winding rows over the pale green stubble .
&quot; Who &apos;s your favorite ? &quot; &quot; Anna and I are for Kuzovlev , &quot; replied Betsy .
I was thinking .... No , no , go along , go on writing ; don &apos;t break off , &quot; she said , pursing up her lips , &quot; and I must cut out these little holes now , do you see ? &quot; She took up her scissors and began cutting them out .
&quot; Can it be true ? &quot; he said at last in a choked voice .
&quot; If you were riding him , &quot; said the Englishman , &quot; I &apos;d bet on you . &quot; &quot; Frou @-@ Frou &apos;s more nervous ; he &apos;s stronger , &quot; said Vronsky , smiling at the compliment to his riding .
Vronsky &apos;s mother , on hearing of his connection , was at first pleased at it , because nothing to her mind gave such a finishing touch to a brilliant young man as a _ liaison _ in the highest society ; she was pleased , too , that Madame Karenina , who had so taken her fancy , and had talked so much of her son , was , after all , just like all other pretty and well @-@ bred women , - at least according to the Countess Vronskaya &apos;s ideas .
Later on , as she got older , dress became more and more distasteful to her .
&quot; Well , and what did you do yesterday ?
The governess , after saying good @-@ morning , began a long and detailed account of Seryozha &apos;s naughtiness , but Anna did not hear her ; she was considering whether she would take her with her or not .
Her head sank , and she sat silent .
&quot; Well , you can lay me down if you like . &quot; Levin laid his brother on his back , sat down beside him , and gazed at his face , holding his breath .
They &apos;re starting ! &quot; was heard on all sides after the hush of expectation .
&quot; They say he was cut in two pieces . &quot; &quot; On the contrary , I think it &apos;s the easiest - instantaneous , &quot; observed another .
He thought it natural because he did it every day , and felt and thought , as it seemed to him , no harm as he did it and consequently he considered modesty in the girl not merely as a relic of barbarism , but also as an insult to himself .
&quot; Run along , run along to Mariette , &quot; she said to Seryozha , who had followed her out , and she began walking up and down on the straw matting of the terrace .
Another series of thoughts and mental images related to the life he longed to live now .
&quot; With her complexion , it &apos;s the one salvation , &quot; responded Madame Trubetskaya .
As though everything that was good in me was all hidden away , and nothing was left but the most loathsome .
With his characteristic decision , without explanation or apology , he simply ceased working at painting .
&quot; It was muddy before , now it will be a perfect swamp . &quot; As he sat in solitude in the closed carriage , he took out his mother &apos;s letter and his brother &apos;s note , and read them through .
Before she had finished speaking , there had come back into his face the stern , reproachful expression of the dying man &apos;s envy of the living .
And for the first time the idea clearly presented itself that it was essential to put an end to this false position , and the sooner the better .
She tried several times to begin to speak , but could not .
She drew back from him with aversion , and without looking in his face answered : &quot; No , no , let me be , I &apos;ll stay . &quot; She saw now that from the place of Vronsky &apos;s accident an officer was running across the course towards the pavilion .
He looked round towards his mother as though seeking shelter .
The sledge @-@ driver was splendid in a white shirt @-@ collar sticking out over his overcoat and into his strong , full @-@ blooded red neck .
Chapter 20 Vronsky was staying in a roomy , clean , Finnish hut , divided into two by a partition .
Shame at their spiritual nakedness crushed her and infected him .
Ah , oh , how horrible it is !
And if you think you &apos;re lowering yourself , well , here &apos;s the floor , there &apos;s the door . &quot; And again his eyes traveled inquiringly over all of them .
&quot; Four days , &quot; Vronsky answered , once more scrutinizing his friend &apos;s face intently .
Dolly was completely comforted in the depression caused by her conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch when she caught sight of the two figures : Kitty with the chalk in her hand , with a shy and happy smile looking upwards at Levin , and his handsome figure bending over the table with glowing eyes fastened one minute on the table and the next on her .
&quot; But why are you going ?
He wrote without using any form of address to her , and wrote in French , making use of the plural &quot; _ vous _ , &quot; which has not the same note of coldness as the corresponding Russian form .
I was at Dussots &quot; yesterday and saw &quot; Karenin &quot; on the visitors &quot; list , but it never entered my head that it was you , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , sticking his head in at the window of the carriage , &quot; or I should have looked you up .
PART ONE Chapter 1 Happy families are all alike ; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way .
But if you want to go abroad , let &apos;s go ! &quot; she said , and trying to appear interested in the proposed tour , she began talking of the preparations for the journey .
It doesn &apos;t matter what about .
There was apparently nothing striking either in her dress or her attitude .
But there was something in her higher than what surrounded her .
Now in the local institutions I , as a nobleman , see nothing that could conduce to my prosperity , and the roads are not better and could not be better ; my horses carry me well enough over bad ones .
&quot; Yes , tell me what &apos;s going on at Pokrovskoe .
She was not the same as she used to be , nor was she as she had been in the carriage ; she was quite different .
She had already had time to look at Vronsky , and looked round at Levin .
For the last few weeks it had been steadily fine frosty weather .
The third circle with which Anna had ties was preeminently the fashionable world - the world of balls , of dinners , of sumptuous dresses , the world that hung on to the court with one hand , so as to avoid sinking to the level of the demi @-@ monde .
He understood that she was driving to Ergushovo from the railway station .
He agreed to everything .
She had found Nikolay Dmitrievitch , had again made it up with him in Moscow , and had moved with him to a provincial town , where he had received a post in the government service .
Levin knew she was listening to his words and that she was glad to listen to him .
&quot; It serves me right , because it was all sham ; because it was all done on purpose , and not from the heart .
Before her he decided to scatter his pearls .
&quot; No , all right , &quot; he shouted again immediately after .
His presence was always sweet to her .
He felt that if he admitted that , it would be proved that he had been talking meaningless rubbish .
&quot; He is engaged , &quot; the clerk responded severely , and he pointed with his pen at the persons waiting , and went on writing .
&quot; Though indeed I fail to comprehend how , with the independence you show , &quot; he went on , getting hot , &quot; - announcing your infidelity to your husband and seeing nothing reprehensible in it , apparently - you can see anything reprehensible in performing a wife &apos;s duties in relation to your husband . &quot; &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch !
He went up to his coachman , who was dozing on the box in the shadow , already lengthening , of a thick limetree ; he admired the shifting clouds of midges circling over the hot horses , and , waking the coachman , he jumped into the carriage , and told him to drive to Bryansky &apos;s .
You must thank Him , and pray to Him for succor .
The scythe cut of itself .
She sent word to her husband that she had come , went to her own room , and occupied herself in sorting out her things , expecting he would come to her .
She told him that she loved him because she understood him completely , because she knew what he would like , and because everything he liked was good .
Her invariable and favorite pursuit , when they met , consisted in making fun of him .
&quot; Yes , &quot; he said ; &quot; the doctor &apos;s been with me today and wasted an hour of my time .
&quot; One cannot disbelieve facts , Darya Alexandrovna , &quot; said he , with an emphasis on the word &quot; facts . &quot; &quot; But what has she done ? &quot; said Darya Alexandrovna .
It was a lovely morning : the bright , cheerful houses with their little gardens , the sight of the red @-@ faced , red @-@ armed , beer @-@ drinking German waitresses , working away merrily , did the heart good .
She fancied that in the mazurka everything must be decided .
&quot; Do let us try table @-@ turning at once , please , &quot; said Vronsky .
Oh , that will be bad for her , my little girl !
What have you come for , Tanya ? &quot; she said in French to the little girl who had come in .
The place was taken , and whenever he tried to imagine any of the girls he knew in that place , he felt that it was utterly impossible .
&quot; I have nothing to say .
She ordered supper to be brought , herself unpacked their things , and herself helped to make the beds , and did not even forget to sprinkle them with Persian powder .
He wrote begging her forgiveness for not having thought of everything before , and promised to come down at the first chance .
And the same instant his head did begin to feel drowsy and he began to drop off into forgetfulness .
At tea , which was brought them on a little tea @-@ table in the cool little drawing @-@ room , the cozy chat promised by Princess Tverskaya before the arrival of her visitors really did come off between the two women .
He made haste to sit down in his easy chair and opened the book .
This was Princess Myakaya , noted for her simplicity and the roughness of her manners , and nicknamed _ enfant terrible _ .
Konstantin Levin heard him , and the disbelief in the sense of all public institutions , which he shared with him , and often expressed , was distasteful to him now from his brother &apos;s lips .
Alexey Alexandrovitch had disliked this new enthusiastic fervor .
He knew that between him and her there could not be , and should not be , secrets , and so he had decided that so it must be .
Without even troubling himself to see Betsy out of his flat , forgetting all his resolutions , without asking when he could see her , where her husband was , Vronsky drove straight to the Karenins . &quot;
He was continually watching and getting to know people of all sorts , and among them peasants , whom he regarded as good and interesting people , and he was continually observing new points in them , altering his former views of them and forming new ones .
I hope &quot; - he was confused , and reddened - &quot; that you will let me arrange and plan our life .
No , it &apos;s too awful ! &quot; She hastily pulled out her handkerchief and hid her face in it .
&quot; Give this to the courier to be delivered to Anna Arkadyevna tomorrow at the summer villa , &quot; he said , getting up .
Serpuhovskoy ?
Levin immediately felt the reproach in the eyes fixed on him , and felt remorse at his own happiness .
At the moment when he was approaching Anna Arkadyevna he noticed too with joy that she was conscious of his being near , and looked round , and seeing him , turned again to her husband .
&quot; Oh , no , Masha , Konstantin Dmitrievitch said he could not believe in it , &quot; said Kitty , blushing for Levin , and Levin saw this , and , still more exasperated , would have answered , but Vronsky with his bright frank smile rushed to the support of the conversation , which was threatening to become disagreeable .
In the expressions of both faces was to be seen vigorous , young , freshly awakened love .
But how wet you are !
In his methodical brain there were distinctly formulated certain aspects of peasant life , deduced partly from that life itself , but chiefly from contrast with other modes of life .
She knew his habit , that had grown into a necessity , of reading in the evening .
Alexey Alexandrovitch made his bows and withdrew .
Of his picture , the one that stood now on his easel , he had at the bottom of his heart one conviction - that no one had ever painted a picture like it .
Kitty , flushed , took her train from Krivin &apos;s knees , and , a little giddy , looked round , seeking Anna .
&quot; Excuse me , doctor , but there is really no object in this .
&quot; Now we shall have sweetmeats to eat , &quot; said Mademoiselle Linon - and Levin drove off to buy sweetmeats .
&quot; Won &apos;t you sit down ? &quot; He indicated an armchair at a writing @-@ table covered with papers .
The longer Levin mowed , the oftener he felt the moments of unconsciousness in which it seemed not his hands that swung the scythe , but the scythe mowing of itself , a body full of life and consciousness of its own , and as though by magic , without thinking of it , the work turned out regular and well @-@ finished of itself .
A cleanly dressed young woman , with clogs on her bare feet , was scrubbing the floor in the new outer room .
I will talk it over with my colleague , and then I will have the honor of laying my opinion before you . &quot; &quot; So we had better leave you ? &quot; &quot; As you please . &quot; The princess went out with a sigh .
In former days , &quot; said Golenishtchev , not observing , or not willing to observe , that both Anna and Vronsky wanted to speak , &quot; in former days the free @-@ thinker was a man who had been brought up in ideas of religion , law , and morality , and only through conflict and struggle came to free @-@ thought ; but now there has sprung up a new type of born free @-@ thinkers who grow up without even having heard of principles of morality or of religion , of the existence of authorities , who grow up directly in ideas of negation in everything , that is to say , savages .
&quot; The commencement of the tuberculous process we are not , as you are aware , able to define ; till there are cavities , there is nothing definite .
The new doctor took up a stethoscope and sounded the patient , shook his head , prescribed medicine , and with extreme minuteness explained first how to take the medicine and then what diet was to be kept to .
Could he talk to her , call her &quot; my dear &quot; ? &quot; And again she could not help mimicking him : &quot; &quot; Anna , _ ma chère _ ; Anna , dear &quot; ! &quot; &quot; He &apos;s not a man , not a human being - he &apos;s a doll !
&quot; Christ is present here unseen , receiving your confession , &quot; he said , pointing to the crucifix .
Alexey Alexandrovitch was weeping , kissing her hands , and saying , &quot; How happy we are now ! &quot; And Alexey Vronsky was there too , and he too was her husband .
For me now ... everything &apos;s at an end !
&quot; Would you like supper ? &quot; &quot; Well , I wouldn &apos;t say no to it .
He was absolutely convinced that nothing could be done to prolong his brother &apos;s life or to relieve his suffering .
The chief reason why the prince was so particularly disagreeable to Vronsky was that he could not help seeing himself in him .
The cry was heard : &quot; Mount ! &quot; Feeling that with the others riding in the race , he was the center upon which all eyes were fastened , Vronsky walked up to his mare in that state of nervous tension in which he usually became deliberate and composed in his movements .
He was embarrassed through a sense that Darya Alexandrovna would be annoyed by receiving from an outsider help that should by rights have come from her own husband .
It &apos;s part of our work , you see .
A small part of the land - the worst part - he let out for rent , while a hundred acres of arable land he cultivated himself with his family and two hired laborers .
Awfully rich , they say .
I know your forest .
She remembered the love for her of the man she loved , and once more all was gladness in her soul , and she lay on the pillow , smiling with happiness .
He would have kissed her ; she pushed him away .
It &apos;s like shop @-@ people .... &quot; &quot; So much prettier .
Ryabinin himself was already in the house , and met the friends in the hall .
don &apos;t you know ? &quot; Matvey put his hands in his jacket pockets , thrust out one leg , and gazed silently , good @-@ humoredly , with a faint smile , at his master .
The feeling of causeless shame , which she had felt on the journey , and her excitement , too , had completely vanished .
She flew over the ditch as though not noticing it .
&quot; And is this all the reward , &quot; said he , &quot; for my ardor ?
But one thing &apos;s awful ....
Fancy !
Do you remember you attacked me for seeking enjoyment in life ?
I &apos;m not a professor of sociology , of course , but it interested me , and really , if it interests you , you ought to study it . &quot; &quot; But what conclusion have they come to ? &quot; &quot; Excuse me .... &quot; The two neighbors had risen , and Sviazhsky , once more checking Levin in his inconvenient habit of peeping into what was beyond the outer chambers of his mind , went to see his guests out .
&quot; How did you like Nilsson ? &quot; he asked .
I &apos;ve had scarlatina , and I &apos;ll persuade mamma to let me . &quot; Kitty insisted on having her way , and went to stay at her sister &apos;s and nursed the children all through the scarlatina , for scarlatina it turned out to be .
They did no harm to anyone , and were all enjoying it .
She &apos;s jealous of me .
The spark of joy kindled in Kitty seemed to have infected everyone in the church .
&quot; He &apos;s been naughty , I think , &quot; answered Annushka with a smile .
&quot; Well , let &apos;s drink to his recovery , or wish that a hundredth part of his dreams may be realized - and that would be happiness such as never has been seen on earth ! &quot; Soon after dinner the guests went away to be in time to be dressed for the wedding .
Women who were quite strangers , mere spectators , were watching it excitedly , holding their breath , in fear of losing a single movement or expression of the bride and bridegroom , and angrily not answering , often not hearing , the remarks of the callous men , who kept making joking or irrelevant observations .
In all these instances the husband had practically ceded or sold his unfaithful wife , and the very party which , being in fault , had not the right to contract a fresh marriage , had formed counterfeit , pseudo @-@ matrimonial ties with a self @-@ styled husband .
It , too , came finally to rest on the last topic , that is , ill @-@ natured gossip .
Looking round him in the twilight of the horse @-@ box , Vronsky unconsciously took in once more in a comprehensive glance all the points of his favorite mare .
All he repented of was that he had not succeeded better in hiding it from his wife .
Konstantin with the help of Masha persuaded him not to go out anywhere , and got him to bed hopelessly drunk .
The voice of a man muffled up and covered with snow shouted something in her ear .
He recognized Anna &apos;s carriage .
&quot; How can new conditions be found ? &quot; said Sviazhsky .
All right ! &quot; said the Englishman ; &quot; don &apos;t upset yourself ! &quot; Vronsky once more took in in one glance the exquisite lines of his favorite mare ; who was quivering all over , and with an effort he tore himself from the sight of her , and went out of the stable .
They knew that he was afraid of everything , afraid of riding a spirited horse .
Sergey Ivanovitch smiled too .
&quot; What , here already ! &quot; she said as she kissed her .
I &apos;m very grateful to you , &quot; she said to the young Swede .
&quot; I &apos;m not too late ? &quot; &quot; All right !
Breaking off what he was saying , Alexey Alexandrovitch got up hurriedly , though with dignity , and bowed low to the general .
He looked at the book and thought of something else .
&quot; At five o &apos;clock , and not evening dress , please , &quot; he shouted once more , turning at the door .
He felt that besides the blessed spiritual force controlling his soul , there was another , a brutal force , as powerful , or more powerful , which controlled his life , and that this force would not allow him that humble peace he longed for .
He felt continually that a great deal was being expected of him - what , he did not know ; and he did everything he was told , and it all gave him happiness .
The raising of this question by a hostile department was in Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s opinion a dishonorable proceeding , seeing that in every department there were things similar and worse , which no one inquired into , for well @-@ known reasons of official etiquette .
&quot; Oh , and when you &apos;ve cleared up , go away yourself , &quot; he added , looking inquiringly at his brother .
&quot; Do you know Madame Karenina ?
Chapter 25 There were seventeen officers in all riding in this race .
&quot; Oh , I shall be delighted , I beg you , &quot; said Mihailov with a forced smile .
Ask any landowner ; he won &apos;t be able to tell you what crop &apos;s profitable , and what &apos;s not . &quot; &quot; Italian bookkeeping , &quot; said the gentleman of the gray whiskers ironically .
And , however much it was instilled into the princess that in our times young people ought to arrange their lives for themselves , she was unable to believe it , just as she would have been unable to believe that , at any time whatever , the most suitable playthings for children five years old ought to be loaded pistols .
When shall we meet ? &quot; &quot; Come tomorrow to the messroom , &quot; said Vronsky , and squeezing him by the sleeve of his coat , with apologies , he moved away to the center of the race course , where the horses were being led for the great steeplechase .
Let him do - that is you - as he likes , &quot; he said , laughing only with his eyes , and putting his hands in his pockets , he watched his master with his head on one side .
&quot; Nice state my rep curtains will be in by the summer ! &quot; he thought , frowning .
Stepan Arkadyevitch comprehended , looked at him , but said nothing .
Love her .
What &apos;s to be done ? &quot; he said to himself in despair , and found no answer .
&quot; When is it to be ?
When she had finished he said : &quot; I &apos;m not delirious .
Moreover , although he had lived so long in the closest relations with the peasants , as farmer and arbitrator , and what was more , as adviser ( the peasants trusted him , and for thirty miles round they would come to ask his advice ) , he had no definite views of &quot; the people , &quot; and would have been as much at a loss to answer the question whether he knew &quot; the people &quot; as the question whether he liked them .
&quot; No , it &apos;s just ending : there he is bowing down to the ground .
After reading a little more of the book on Egyptian hieroglyphics , and renewing his interest in it , Alexey Alexandrovitch went to bed at eleven o &apos;clock , and recollecting as he lay in bed the incident with his wife , he saw it now in by no means such a gloomy light .
Sergey Ivanovitch had caught nothing , but he was not bored , and seemed in the most cheerful frame of mind .
This elder son , too , was displeased with his younger brother .
Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled mournfully , looked at his brother @-@ in @-@ law , and without answering went up to the table , took from it an unfinished letter , and handed it to his brother @-@ in @-@ law .
But the time came when I knew that I couldn &apos;t cheat myself any longer , that I was alive , that I was not to blame , that God has made me so that I must love and live .
Over the snow @-@ covered roofs could be seen a decorated cross with chains , and above it the rising triangle of Charles &apos;s Wain with the yellowish light of Capella .
She &apos;s quite alone , poor thing .
Passing in mental review all the instances he knew of divorces ( there were plenty of them in the very highest society with which he was very familiar ) , Alexey Alexandrovitch could not find a single example in which the object of divorce was that which he had in view .
This was how I was lying , and this was how he was standing .
&quot; And I &apos;ll write to Moscow . &quot; He pressed her hand , and again kissed it .
Then he recalled the scandal with a sharper , to whom he had lost money , and given a promissory note , and against whom he had himself lodged a complaint , asserting that he had cheated him .
He kissed the palm of his hand where she had touched it , and went home , happy in the sense that he had got nearer to the attainment of his aims that evening than during the last two months .
But now everything shall go on in a new way .
&quot; Yes , I want a little air .
Looking towards the plough land across the river , he made out something black , but he could not distinguish whether it was a horse or the bailiff on horseback .
a game of bezique , champagne with Ignatov ?
All he wanted now was to be better than before .
&quot; Well , how is he ? &quot; Kitty asked with a frightened face .
&quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch , leave me Seryozha ! &quot; she whispered once more .
Come in this evening .
how is he ? &quot; she turned to her husband and then to her .
Yes . &quot; &quot; Oh !
Or ... he could not conceive what would become of him if he were rejected .
Chapter 6 Alexey Alexandrovitch had gained a brilliant victory at the sitting of the Commission of the 17th of August , but in the sequel this victory cut the ground from under his feet .
You never put in an appearance anywhere , and I haven &apos;t seen you ever since Anna has been ill .
&quot; What do I know ?
He was jealous of Vronsky , as he had been a year ago , as though the evening he had seen her with Vronsky had been yesterday .
Liza was as soft and enervated as Sappho was smart and abrupt .
Behind him came a peasant , and he too was evidently tired , for he stopped at once without waiting to mow up to Levin , and began whetting his scythe .
And she was marveling that it had once seemed impossible to her , was explaining to them , laughing , that this was ever so much simpler , and that now both of them were happy and contented .
Alexey Alexandrovitch saw this , but could do nothing .
&quot; Yes , he realizes all the gravity of it , &quot; she thought , and gratefully she pressed his hand .
Well , and your wife ? &quot; said the baroness suddenly , interrupting Vronsky &apos;s conversation with his comrade .
The conversation dropped at the jest .
In order to work out the whole subject theoretically and to complete his book , which , in Levin &apos;s daydreams , was not merely to effect a revolution in political economy , but to annihilate that science entirely and to lay the foundation of a new science of the relation of the people to the soil , all that was left to do was to make a tour abroad , and to study on the spot all that had been done in the same direction , and to collect conclusive evidence that all that had been done there was not what was wanted .
The hall @-@ porter stood holding open the great door of the house .
Remember , cannot nine years of my life atone for an instant .... &quot; She dropped her eyes and listened , expecting what he would say , as it were beseeching him in some way or other to make her believe differently .
Such debts amounted to about four thousand : one thousand five hundred for a horse , and two thousand five hundred as surety for a young comrade , Venovsky , who had lost that sum to a cardsharper in Vronsky &apos;s presence .
That you know - whether there is enough for you to be able to forgive him .
&quot; When shall I see you again ? &quot; asked Varenka .
Darkness had fallen upon everything for him ; but just because of this darkness he felt that the one guiding clue in the darkness was his work , and he clutched it and clung to it with all his strength .
Chapter 35 The prince communicated his good humor to his own family and his friends , and even to the German landlord in whose rooms the Shtcherbatskys were staying .
&quot; Stiva ! &quot; said Levin unexpectedly ; &quot; how is it you don &apos;t tell me whether your sister @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s married yet , or when she &apos;s going to be ? &quot; Levin felt so resolute and serene that no answer , he fancied , could affect him .
Then he told Kitty she was looking very pretty that evening , and presented Shtcherbatsky to Karenin .
But he noticed that to the rest of the party this appeared something striking and improper , and for that reason it seemed to him too to be improper .
&quot; Do tell me something amusing but not spiteful , &quot; said the ambassador &apos;s wife , a great proficient in the art of that elegant conversation called by the English _ small talk _ .
&quot; Where did you stop ? &quot; Vassily pointed to the mark with his foot , and Levin went forward as best he could , scattering the seed on the land .
Stepan Arkadyevitch had not made a mistake in inviting Pestsov .
&quot; Perhaps it may all be very good ; but why should I worry myself about establishing dispensaries which I shall never make use of , and schools to which I shall never send my children , to which even the peasants don &apos;t want to send their children , and to which I &apos;ve no very firm faith that they ought to send them ? &quot; said he .
I must explain my feelings , the feelings that have guided me and will guide me , so that you may not be in error regarding me .
&quot; I &apos;ve long , always wished for this ! &quot; said the prince , taking Levin by the arm and drawing him towards himself .
&quot; I know , of course , &quot; said Levin , &quot; that that simply means that you would like to see me , and I &apos;m exceedingly glad .
The first days of her existence in the country were very hard for Dolly .
&quot; And is he as stupid and pleased as ever ?
They enjoyed hearing the epistle read , and the roll of the head deacon &apos;s voice at the last verse , awaited with such impatience by the outside public .
Now I shall understand what the mysterious business is that you are always absorbed in here .
He had left him , as often happens , only the external faculty of memory , that points out each step one has to take , one after the other .
The thought of this made him cold and hostile to her .
&quot; The race lost !
Driving was out of the question , because one of the horses was restive , and bolted in the shafts .
Acted like a man , he did !
And truly Levin had never drunk any liquor so good as this warm water with green bits floating in it , and a taste of rust from the tin dipper .
His brother , Darya Alexandrovna , and Stepan Arkadyevitch , all in full dress , were waiting for him to bless him with the holy picture .
And he answered simply , though jestingly .
Everyone with whom the princess had chanced to discuss the matter said the same thing : &quot; Mercy on us , it &apos;s high time in our day to cast off all that old @-@ fashioned business .
Greeting and saying a few words to everyone , he sat down without once glancing at Levin , who had never taken his eyes off him .
On finishing yet another row he would have gone back to the top of the meadow again to begin the next , but Tit stopped , and going up to the old man said something in a low voice to him .
Angry with himself for so base a feeling , Levin ran into the hall ; as soon as he had seen his brother close , this feeling of selfish disappointment vanished instantly and was replaced by pity .
This sigh seemed to exasperate Nikolay still more .
&quot; What &apos;s to be done ?
She hardly knew at times what it was she feared , and what she hoped for .
&quot; The most utterly loathsome and coarse : I can &apos;t tell you .
Vronsky and Anna still sat at the little table .
He knew too that the brains of many great men , whose thoughts he had read , had brooded over death and yet knew not a hundredth part of what his wife and Agafea Mihalovna knew about it .
And looking at herself for the last time in the looking @-@ glass she was satisfied with herself .
He had said that , but now thinking things over he saw clearly that it would be better to manage to avoid that ; and at the same time , as he told himself so , he was afraid whether it was not wrong .
He had often had the experience of suddenly in a discussion grasping what it was his opponent liked and at once liking it too , and immediately he found himself agreeing , and then all arguments fell away as useless .
I wouldn &apos;t say this to your brother .
&quot; Why , have you met ? &quot; inquired their host .
What he had just heard about Kitty excited and delighted him .
With the same complacent smile he told her of the ovations he had received in consequence of the act he had passed .
Eh ?
Betsy promised to fetch me . &quot; Vronsky , looking at his watch , went away hurriedly .
&quot; He persists in refusing to give me a divorce !
&quot; No , &quot; she went on , &quot; she did not know how .... Luckily , I learned a lot at Soden . &quot; &quot; Surely there are not people there so ill ? &quot; &quot; Worse . &quot; &quot; What &apos;s so awful to me is that I can &apos;t see him as he was when he was young .
Finally his decision was pronounced : they were to go abroad , but to put no faith in foreign quacks , and to apply to him in any need .
&quot; But what is there interesting about it ?
&quot; I was very , very glad .
&quot; I know , &quot; she interrupted him , &quot; how hard it is for your truthful nature to lie , and I grieve for you .
A cigar is a sort of thing , not exactly a pleasure , but the crown and outward sign of pleasure .
As he drove up to the Karenins &quot; entrance he looked at his watch and saw it was ten minutes to nine .
You shall see how to be happy . &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;ve done with it all .
&quot; For pity &apos;s sake , not a word , not a word more . &quot; She rose quickly and moved away from him .
Baroness Shilton , a friend of Petritsky &apos;s , with a rosy little face and flaxen hair , resplendent in a lilac satin gown , and filling the whole room , like a canary , with her Parisian chatter , sat at the round table making coffee .
Yes ? &quot; &quot; Yes , yes . &quot; Their conversation was interrupted by Mademoiselle Linon , who with an affected but tender smile came to congratulate her favorite pupil .
It was at once answered by the appearance of an old friend , his valet , Matvey , carrying his clothes , his boots , and a telegram .
And what he saw in this mirror did not gratify his self @-@ esteem .
I ought to tell you .... Can you forgive that ? &quot; &quot; Perhaps it was for the best .
He felt that his brother would not look at it as he would have wished him to .
&quot; I am very grateful for your sympathy , but I must be going , &quot; he said , getting up .
But as he approached his mother @-@ in @-@ law , he responded in a mournful and crestfallen tone to her inquiries about Dolly &apos;s health .
He knew that this was stupid , he knew that it was positively not right , and contrary to his present new plans , but this house was a whole world to Levin .
I am to blame , and punish me , make me expiate my fault .
&quot; All is over , &quot; she said ; &quot; I have nothing but you .
How happy you are , Anna ! &quot; said Dolly .
When one was in a good temper , and the other in a bad temper , the peace was not broken ; but when both happened to be in an ill @-@ humor , quarrels sprang up from such incomprehensibly trifling causes , that they could never remember afterwards what they had quarreled about .
At the sight of Anna , her whole face lighted up at once with a smile of delight .
But it did not interest her at all .
There &apos;s a fable of Grimm &apos;s about a man without a shadow , a man who &apos;s lost his shadow .
Towards morning Anna sank into a doze , sitting in her place , and when she waked it was daylight and the train was near Petersburg .
Vronsky &apos;s quarters were always a meeting place for all the officers .
However hard it is for you , believe me , it is more terrible for me . &quot; He would have risen ; but Alexey Alexandrovitch took him by the hand and said : &quot; I beg you to hear me out ; it is necessary .
She was standing talking to a lady at the opposite end of the ground .
It was not his brother .
And here let them do what they like , &quot; said Tchirikov , smiling .
Petritsky jumped up suddenly onto his knees and looked round .
&quot; But we take our stand on principle as the ideal , &quot; replied Pestsov in his mellow bass .
&quot; If I told her to leave her husband , that must mean uniting her life with mine ; am I prepared for that ?
The prince listened to the princess &apos;s scolding rather a long while without speaking , but his face was more and more frowning .
But this sense of his own humiliation before the man he had unjustly despised made up only a small part of his misery .
Chapter 14 When Kitty had gone and Levin was left alone , he felt such uneasiness without her , and such an impatient longing to get as quickly , as quickly as possible , to tomorrow morning , when he would see her again and be plighted to her forever , that he felt afraid , as though of death , of those fourteen hours that he had to get through without her .
&quot; What a shame of you not to let us know ! &quot; he repeated .
&quot; As God wills , the sun &apos;s not high .
Why didn &apos;t you offer Ryabinin something ? &quot; &quot; Oh , damn him ! &quot; &quot; Still , how you do treat him ! &quot; said Oblonsky .
&quot; But here &apos;s this lady too , and others very much moved as well ; it &apos;s very natural , &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch told himself .
&quot; When can I reckon on receiving information from you ? &quot; he asked , moving towards the door , his eyes and his varnished boots shining .
Woman , don &apos;t you know , is such a subject that however much you study it , it &apos;s always perfectly new . &quot; &quot; Well , then , it would be better not to study it . &quot; &quot; No .
The sick man fell into a quiet sleep , but he was waked up half an hour later by his cough .
But to deny the facts is no answer .
Of course , that was nonsense ; but there was a dispute over it - over you .
Now he wanted to go there , and he pondered the question how to do it .
And the full chorus of the unseen choir rose up , filling the whole church , from the windows to the vaulted roof , with broad waves of melody .
&quot; I meant to say ...
He smiled to his wife as a man should smile on meeting his wife after only just parting from her , and greeted the princess and other acquaintances , giving to each what was due - that is to say , jesting with the ladies and dealing out friendly greetings among the men .
Every time he began to think about it , he felt that he must try once more , that by kindness , tenderness , and persuasion there was still hope of saving her , of bringing her back to herself , and every day he made ready to talk to her .
Fedot , don &apos;t let out the gelding , but take it to the trough , and we &apos;ll put the other in harness . &quot; &quot; Oh , father , the ploughshares I ordered , has he brought them along ? &quot; asked the big , healthy @-@ looking fellow , obviously the old man &apos;s son .
PART TWO Chapter 1 At the end of the winter , in the Shtcherbatskys &quot; house , a consultation was being held , which was to pronounce on the state of Kitty &apos;s health and the measures to be taken to restore her failing strength .
He called Vronsky &quot; your excellency , &quot; and notwithstanding Anna &apos;s and Vronsky &apos;s invitations , he would never stay to dinner , nor come except for the sittings .
He had not yet seen her there .
Here , you &apos;ve been married , you know the feeling ... it &apos;s awful that we - old - with a past ... not of love , but of sins ... are brought all at once so near to a creature pure and innocent ; it &apos;s loathsome , and that &apos;s why one can &apos;t help feeling oneself unworthy . &quot; &quot; Oh , well , you &apos;ve not many sins on your conscience . &quot; &quot; Alas !
&quot; Very well , next Saturday , &quot; answered Countess Nordston .
&quot; This cheese is not bad .
Dolly came up , tried to say something , but could not speak , cried , and then laughed unnaturally .
You &apos;ve not answered my question , though , &quot; he went on , with a desperate effort looking Oblonsky straight in the face .
But the old man bent down every time he came across a mushroom , picked it up and put it in his bosom .
&quot; It &apos;s time to start , though , &quot; said she , glancing at her watch .
&quot; Oh , there &apos;s Karenin ! &quot; said the acquaintance with whom he was chatting .
The wife had discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a French girl , who had been a governess in their family , and she had announced to her husband that she could not go on living in the same house with him .
But this will soon all be over .... Only one thing I want : forgive me , forgive me quite .
Even when his brother or Kitty bent over him , so that he could see them , he looked just the same .
The new commission for the inquiry into the condition of the native tribes in all its branches had been formed and despatched to its destination with an unusual speed and energy inspired by Alexey Alexandrovitch .
and what a nice face he has ! &quot; said the prince .
what cold hands ! &quot; he said .
Several invalids were lingering near the low carriage , staring at the lady as though she were some curiosity .
But why doesn &apos;t he come ?
&quot; And whom are you meeting ? &quot; he asked .
The carriage and two hired cabs were waiting at the steps .
&quot; Come , tell me , please , what you did abroad ?
Although it seemed to Levin that he was not hungry , and he sat down to dinner simply so as not to hurt Kouzma &apos;s feelings , yet when he began to eat the dinner struck him as extraordinarily good .
Don &apos;t I love him more than before ?
You expect a great deal of this ball , and you want everyone to be there to take part in it . &quot; &quot; How do you know ?
my God !
&quot; You think it &apos;s possible ? &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s possible .
What are your special sins ? &quot; he added , without the slightest interval , as though anxious not to waste time .
Then how can you doubt that God created all ? &quot; the priest said , with good @-@ humored perplexity .
&quot; Everything has been delightful .
Levin was almost of the same age as Oblonsky ; their intimacy did not rest merely on champagne .
If not today , tomorrow , if not tomorrow , in thirty years , wasn &apos;t it all the same !
No .
Or perhaps not ...
Was it of him they were speaking when they said the rider was unhurt , but the horse had broken its back ?
He ought , as he conceived the position , to do his work , and to find repose from it in the happiness of love .
Alexander has been very good , and Marie has grown very pretty .
And this was what caused his dubious , inquiring , sometimes hostile , expression , and the shyness and uncertainty which Vronsky found so irksome .
Madame Stahl had now been living more than ten years continuously abroad , in the south , never leaving her couch .
The driver knew the Shtcherbatskys &quot; house , and drew up at the entrance with a curve of his arm and a &quot; Wo ! &quot; especially indicative of respect for his fare .
He was happy ; but on entering upon family life he saw at every step that it was utterly different from what he had imagined .
&quot; Yes , yes .
For a long time they tried to set him right and made him begin again - because he kept taking Kitty by the wrong arm or with the wrong arm - till he understood at last that what he had to do was , without changing his position , to take her right hand in his right hand .
The crop was a splendid one , and bright , hot summer days had set in with short , dewy nights .
He is gone ? &quot; &quot; Thank God it &apos;s over !
At once thoughts of home , of husband and of son , and the details of that day and the following came upon her .
His hair had grown thinner , the same straight mustaches hid his lips , the same eyes gazed strangely and naïvely at his visitor .
And I &apos;m glad I went . &quot; &quot; Yes , I knew your idea of the solution of the labor question . &quot; &quot; Not a bit : in Russia there can be no labor question .
Anna Pavlovna had met Kitty with affected cordiality , and had kept continual watch on her and on her husband .
Besides the service and society , Vronsky had another great interest - horses ; he was passionately fond of horses .
&quot; I &apos;ll work it out later .
&quot; I &apos;ve wanted to tell you so a long while , &quot; she added , and moving a few steps away , she sat down at a table in a corner covered with albums .
I &apos;m seeing no one because I &apos;m unwell , countess , &quot; he said , and his lips twitched .
And your husband knew it and forgave it . &quot; He stopped at each sentence , waiting for her to object , but she made no answer .
But in the depths of his heart , the older he became , and the more intimately he knew his brother , the more and more frequently the thought struck him that this faculty of working for the public good , of which he felt himself utterly devoid , was possibly not so much a quality as a lack of something - not a lack of good , honest , noble desires and tastes , but a lack of vital force , of what is called heart , of that impulse which drives a man to choose someone out of the innumerable paths of life , and to care only for that one .
I &apos;m busy looking after the land , &quot; answered Konstantin , watching with horror the greediness with which his brother ate and drank , and trying to conceal that he noticed it .
You made an attempt and didn &apos;t succeed , as you think , and you give in .
Princess Shtcherbatskaya had herself been married thirty years ago , her aunt arranging the match .
&quot; I don &apos;t want a divorce ; it &apos;s all the same to me now .
For a moment she regained her self @-@ possession , and realized that the thin peasant who had come in wearing a long overcoat , with buttons missing from it , was the stoveheater , that he was looking at the thermometer , that it was the wind and snow bursting in after him at the door ; but then everything grew blurred again .... That peasant with the long waist seemed to be gnawing something on the wall , the old lady began stretching her legs the whole length of the carriage , and filling it with a black cloud ; then there was a fearful shrieking and banging , as though someone were being torn to pieces ; then there was a blinding dazzle of red fire before her eyes and a wall seemed to rise up and hide everything .
But afterwards a change came over Anna &apos;s face which really was beyond decorum .
&quot; No , she does not love him and cannot love him , &quot; he decided to himself .
You married men , especially you , Stepan Arkadyevitch , are the real patriots : what number have you reached ? &quot; he said , smiling genially at their host and holding out a tiny wine @-@ glass to him .
Vronsky was more than cordial with him , and was obviously interested to know the artist &apos;s opinion of his picture .
&quot; Queer fish ! &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch to his wife , and glancing at his watch , he made a motion of his hand before his face , indicating a caress to his wife and children , and walked jauntily along the pavement .
&quot; Then why did you marry ?
&quot; But other people noticed it , and that &apos;s what upsets him . &quot; - &quot; You &apos;re not well , Alexey Alexandrovitch , &quot; she added , and she got up , and would have gone towards the door ; but he moved forward as though he would stop her .
He could not supply the word she had meant ; but in her charming eyes , beaming with happiness , he saw all he needed to know .
Here , too , was Tit , Levin &apos;s preceptor in the art of mowing , a thin little peasant .
&quot; Why , have you been going in for gymnastics again ? &quot; he asked Levin , pinching his muscle with his left hand .
There were some here today asking seventy roubles for the summer . &quot; Levin was silent .
&quot; You desire my assistance in securing a divorce ? &quot; &quot; Yes , precisely so ; but I ought to warn you that I may be wasting your time and attention .
Anna was absorbed the whole morning in preparations for her departure .
) , and he was dissatisfied with himself for not showing more strength of will .
Again a flush of shame spread over her face ; she recalled his composure , and a feeling of anger against him impelled her to tear the sheet with the phrase she had written into tiny bits .
&quot; Well , she &apos;s the second angel , then , &quot; said the prince , smiling .
&quot; Ah !
And how happy I should be if I could arrange things ! &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , smiling more boldly .
&quot; Oh , very well , very well ! ...
She spoke the truth .
you shall burn for this ! &quot; This man , so subtle and astute in official life , did not realize all the senselessness of such an attitude to his wife .
One wild untrained female voice broke into a song , and sang it alone through a verse , and then the same verse was taken up and repeated by half a hundred strong healthy voices , of all sorts , coarse and fine , singing in unison .
&quot; Well done !
Tomorrow I shall start mowing . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so fond of that form of field labor , &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch .
But in spite of all the murderer &apos;s horror before the body of his victim , he must hack it to pieces , hide the body , must use what he has gained by his murder .
She forgave him ; but from that time more than ever he considered himself unworthy of her , morally bowed down lower than ever before her , and prized more highly than ever his undeserved happiness .
nowadays there &apos;s no chance at all of stealing .
An attempt at divorce could lead to nothing but a public scandal , which would be a perfect godsend to his enemies for calumny and attacks on his high position in society .
&quot; You won &apos;t go either , will you ?
He began to speak with greater heat .
It was quite still now in the copse , and not a bird was stirring .
I &apos;m collecting subscriptions .
&quot; But why was it so awful ? &quot; He vividly recalled the peasant again and those incomprehensible French words the peasant had uttered , and a chill of horror ran down his spine .
But when Levin hinted at the future advantages , Ivan &apos;s face expressed alarm and regret that he could not hear all he had to say , and he made haste to find himself some task that would admit of no delay : he either snatched up the fork to pitch the hay out of the pens , or ran to get water or to clear out the dung .
And he was told , &quot; Don &apos;t trouble , your honor , sure , the womenfolks will pitch it quick enough . &quot; The ploughs were practically useless , because it never occurred to the laborer to raise the share when he turned the plough , and forcing it round , he strained the horses and tore up the ground , and Levin was begged not to mind about it .
I &apos;m an overstrained string that must snap .
After the thunder showers of the last few days , cold , bright weather had set in .
Please don &apos;t be angry , &quot; he said , and smiling , he took his hand .
&quot; Mamma will be down directly .
Levin scowled , and without answering her , he sat down again to his work , repeating to himself all that he had been thinking of the real significance of that work .
They were driving on their way to dinner with a friend in the most festive state of mind .
&quot; No matter , &quot; thought Alexey Alexandrovitch , &quot; so much the better .
Let us try to look upon the labor force not as an abstract force , but as the _ Russian peasant _ with his instincts , and we shall arrange our system of culture in accordance with that .
&quot; My life , too , has been a wonderful one .
Exactly at half @-@ past nine she heard his ring , and he came into the room .
In my article I &apos;ve .... &quot; &quot; I tell you what , &quot; said Anna , who had for a long while been exchanging wary glances with Vronsky , and knew that he was not in the least interested in the education of this artist , but was simply absorbed by the idea of assisting him , and ordering a portrait of him ; &quot; I tell you what , &quot; she said , resolutely interrupting Golenishtchev , who was still talking away , &quot; let &apos;s go and see him ! &quot; Golenishtchev recovered his self @-@ possession and readily agreed .
&quot; If after your avowal to him at your country house he had broken with you , if he had called me out - but this I can &apos;t understand .
How do you explain the sudden way in which you vanished from Moscow ?
But what step could and ought to be taken he could not imagine .
The talk was principally kept up by the men , while the women were absorbed in watching every detail of the ceremony , which always means so much to them .
When I doubted , I had hope ; but now there is no hope , and still I doubt of everything .
Levin had not the heart to disillusion him of the notion that there could be something delightful apart from her , and so said nothing .
And here I am living on .
&quot; Have you been here long ? &quot; she said , giving him her hand .
&quot; You don &apos;t want to organize anything ; it &apos;s simply just as you &apos;ve been all your life , that you want to be original to pose as not exploiting the peasants simply , but with some idea in view . &quot; &quot; Oh , all right , that &apos;s what you think - and let me alone ! &quot; answered Levin , feeling the muscles of his left cheek twitching uncontrollably .
I do value my idea and my work awfully ; but in reality only consider this : all this world of ours is nothing but a speck of mildew , which has grown up on a tiny planet .
The first fall - Kuzovlev &apos;s , at the stream - agitated everyone , but Alexey Alexandrovitch saw distinctly on Anna &apos;s pale , triumphant face that the man she was watching had not fallen .
And we &apos;re all counting on you . &quot; &quot; I want to tell you that I can &apos;t dine at your house , because the terms of relationship which have existed between us must cease . &quot; &quot; How ?
&quot; I didn &apos;t know you were going .
These were principally accounts owing in connection with his race horses , to the purveyor of oats and hay , the English saddler , and so on .
On meeting Betsy coming towards her in a white gown that struck her by its elegance , Anna smiled at her just as she always did .
He did not realize it , because it was too terrible to him to realize his actual position , and he shut down and locked and sealed up in his heart that secret place where lay hid his feelings towards his family , that is , his wife and son .
That was clear .
He remembered how before starting for Moscow he had once said to his cowman Nikolay , a simple @-@ hearted peasant , whom he liked talking to : &quot; Well , Nikolay !
To their amazement , the fair one alights at the entrance of the very house to which they were going .
She &apos;s very interesting . &quot; And she began telling him again of what interested her most - the christening of her grandson , for which she had been staying in Petersburg , and the special favor shown her elder son by the Tsar .
Levin himself had felt on seeing Kitty Shtcherbatskaya that he had never ceased to love her ; but he could not go over to the Oblonskys , &quot; knowing she was there .
We can eat at night .
Please forgive me , if I &apos;ve been nasty , &quot; said Levin .
Chapter 8 When the professor had gone , Sergey Ivanovitch turned to his brother .
Alexey Alexandrovitch sat down , and with a despondent and suffering face watched the nurse walking to and fro .
Agafea Mihalovna , speaking of the man just dead , had said : &quot; Well , thank God , he took the sacrament and received absolution ; God grant each one of us such a death . &quot; Katya in just the same way , besides all her care about linen , bedsores , drink , found time the very first day to persuade the sick man of the necessity of taking the sacrament and receiving absolution .
&quot; I don &apos;t think it important ; it does not take hold of me , I can &apos;t help it , &quot; answered Levin , making out that what he saw was the bailiff , and that the bailiff seemed to be letting the peasants go off the ploughed land .
what can I do in this fearful business , &quot; he thought , &quot; without help ?
Very soon Marya Philimonovna had established her club , so to say , under the acacias , and there it was , in this club , consisting of the bailiff &apos;s wife , the village elder , and the counting @-@ house clerk , that the difficulties of existence were gradually smoothed away , and in a week &apos;s time everything actually had come round .
I have doubts of everything , and for the most part I am in doubt . &quot; &quot; Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind , &quot; the priest repeated the same words .
Anna suddenly turned to him .
Give me some morphine .
Wurt , indeed , says plainly that , assuming there are no sensations , it follows that there is no idea of existence . &quot; &quot; I maintain the contrary , &quot; began Sergey Ivanovitch .
&quot; To go , or not to go ! &quot; he said to himself ; and an inner voice told him he must not go , that nothing could come of it but falsity ; that to amend , to set right their relations was impossible , because it was impossible to make her attractive again and able to inspire love , or to make him an old man , not susceptible to love .
what have I done ? &quot; he cried , and kneeling before her , he fell to kissing her hands .
The next time it was just the same .
One arm of this body was above the quilt , and the wrist , huge as a rake @-@ handle , was attached , inconceivably it seemed , to the thin , long bone of the arm smooth from the beginning to the middle .
&quot; I know you and the good &quot; - again he caught a moth - &quot; work you are doing , like every Russian , &quot; said the lawyer , bowing .
When she had recovered , she said good @-@ bye , and went into the house to get her hat .
Very likely ...
&quot; What are you looking at there ? &quot; he said to Levin , who was standing at the round table looking through the reviews .
His brother listened , but evidently he was not interested by it .
The fact that he had made her an offer , and she had refused him , had placed an insuperable barrier between her and him .
When he came out of the forest , in the immense plain before him , his grass fields stretched in an unbroken carpet of green , without one bare place or swamp , only spotted here and there in the hollows with patches of melting snow .
You should come over here by us . &quot; &quot; No , we &apos;re very happy here , &quot; the ambassador &apos;s wife responded with a smile , and she went on with the conversation that had been begun .
We know what the land &apos;s like - first @-@ rate , yet there &apos;s not much of a crop to boast of .
Yesterday .... &quot; She talked on , not knowing what her lips were uttering , and not taking her supplicating and caressing eyes off him .
&quot; Thou who didst from the beginning create male and female , &quot; the priest read after the exchange of rings , &quot; from Thee woman was given to man to be a helpmeet to him , and for the procreation of children .
Talk of something : why are you silent ? &quot; And directly they began to talk he would close his eyes , and would show weariness , indifference , and loathing .
I am myself to blame .
I did not know &quot; ( though he did know ) , Golenishtchev answered carelessly .
Behind the fog there was the flowing of water , the cracking and floating of ice , the swift rush of turbid , foaming torrents ; and on the following Monday , in the evening , the fog parted , the storm clouds split up into little curling crests of cloud , the sky cleared , and the real spring had come .
And now as she made surmises as to who people were , what were their relations to one another , and what they were like , Kitty endowed them with the most marvelous and noble characters , and found confirmation of her idea in her observations .
Ah , how glad I am to see you ! &quot; he shouted , recognizing Stepan Arkadyevitch .
Anna looked at her with eyes wet with tears .
Stiva is staying a long while in Dolly &apos;s room , thank God , &quot; Anna added , changing the subject , and getting up , Kitty fancied , displeased with something .
They ask me , are they to light the candles that have been lighted before or candles that have never been lighted ?
Anyway &quot; ( Alexey Alexandrovitch knew what was meant by that &quot; anyway &quot; ) , &quot; she &apos;s a baby , and they &apos;re killing her . &quot; She rang the bell and ordered the baby to be brought her .
Levin recognized some of his own men .
On the material side the dinner was a success ; it was no less so on the immaterial .
So that in fact you &apos;re making him a present of thirty thousand . &quot; &quot; Come , don &apos;t let your imagination run away with you , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch piteously .
&quot; At the time when you made Kitty an offer she was just in a position in which she could not answer .
And his brother Nikolay &apos;s gentleness did in fact not last out for long .
Whether she feared or desired what had happened , or what was going to happen , and exactly what she longed for , she could not have said .
Socialism told him that development along these lines leads to ruin .
What was it exactly they told you , if I may know ? &quot; he questioned .
He was soon aware that there was springing up in his heart a desire for desires - _ ennui _ .
why are you so depressed ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not depressed . &quot; &quot; Where are you off to ?
&quot; Please go for me , there &apos;s a little bottle in my small bag , &quot; she said , turning to her husband , &quot; you know , in the side pocket ; bring it , please , and meanwhile they &apos;ll finish clearing up here . &quot; Returning with the bottle , Levin found the sick man settled comfortably and everything about him completely changed .
&quot; Go away , go out of the room ! &quot; she shrieked still more shrilly , &quot; and don &apos;t talk to me of your passion and your loathsomeness . &quot; She tried to go out , but tottered , and clung to the back of a chair to support herself .
&quot; I must get ready .
&quot; No , it seems to be beginning again , &quot; he thought , listening to the prayers .
She blushed and laughed with delight ; &quot; Really I don &apos;t remember . &quot; &quot; How nicely Turovtsin laughs ! &quot; said Levin , admiring his moist eyes and shaking chest .
And in this struggle he saw that with immense expenditure of force on his side , and with no effort or even intention on the other side , all that was attained was that the work did not go to the liking of either side , and that splendid tools , splendid cattle and land were spoiled with no good to anyone .
Noticing that Countess Nordston wanted to say something , he stopped short without finishing what he had begun , and listened attentively to her .
&quot; Well then , &quot; Vronsky began to start a conversation of some sort ; &quot; so you &apos;re settled here ?
How is it best to act in this awful position - that &apos;s what you must think of . &quot; &quot; All &apos;s over , and there &apos;s nothing more , &quot; said Dolly .
If you are convinced now that you cannot make each other happy .... &quot; &quot; Happiness may be variously understood .
&quot; I came up yesterday , and I &apos;m delighted that I shall see your triumph .
You simply must come to dinner with us today .
The week before , Kitty had told her mother of a conversation she had with Vronsky during a mazurka .
So that he needed at least six thousand roubles for current expenses , and he only had one thousand eight hundred .
Chapter 10 &quot; Kitty writes to me that there &apos;s nothing she longs for so much as quiet and solitude , &quot; Dolly said after the silence that had followed .
It was only when their wondering and timid eyes met that he believed in it , because he felt that they were one .
The clerk took the card and , obviously not approving of what he read on it , went to the door .
is there something new , then ? &quot; queried Levin .
That was just what her son was thinking .
The appurtenances of the writing @-@ tables , about which Alexey Alexandrovitch was himself very fastidious , were exceptionally good .
Even the Tatar , uncorking the bottle and pouring the sparkling wine into the delicate glasses , glanced at Stepan Arkadyevitch , and settled his white cravat with a perceptible smile of satisfaction .
He saw that , in spite of Agafea Mihalovna &apos;s feelings being hurt by a new mistress taking the reins of government out of her hands , Kitty had yet conquered her and made her love her .
But he had hardly finished writing when she read them over her arm , and herself finished and wrote the answer , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re playing _ secrétaire _ ? &quot; said the old prince .
I can &apos;t understand it !
&quot; You &apos;ve never had , and never have , convictions ; all you want is to please your vanity . &quot; &quot; Oh , very well ; then let me alone ! &quot; &quot; And I will let you alone !
He went on with his work , but he felt now that the center of gravity of his attention had passed to something else , and that consequently he looked at his work quite differently and more clearly .
Yes , if he went away early , and was out of humor too , it must mean it .... He &apos;s been so long in love , and I &apos;m very sorry for him . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s it !
The one mystery of death , still unsolved , had scarcely passed before his eyes , when another mystery had arisen , as insoluble , urging him to love and to life .
She did not remember the precise sum , but it appeared that the German had worked it out to the fraction of a farthing .
&quot; And this is how we &apos;re preparing wretchedness for Kitty ; and she &apos;s really got the notion into her head .... &quot; &quot; But what makes you suppose so ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t suppose ; I know .
And if there &apos;s a good crop you shall have half a rouble for every acre . &quot; &quot; Humbly thankful .
Now please don &apos;t fret over your son ; you can &apos;t expect never to be parted . &quot; Madame Karenina stood quite still , holding herself very erect , and her eyes were smiling .
But the rains began , preventing the harvesting of the corn and potatoes left in the fields , and putting a stop to all work , even to the delivery of the wheat .
But just think a little : this is a matter of such importance that I can &apos;t bear to think that you should bring in a feeling of weakness , of dislike to being left alone .
&quot; Oh , no ! &quot; she answered , getting up after him and accompanying him across the room to his study .
She was in a corner , and turning out her slender feet in their high boots with obvious timidity , she skated towards him .
&quot; He looked round , &quot; she thought .
&quot; And here &apos;s the glory of Peterhof , Princess Tverskaya , &quot; he added , looking out of the window at the elegant English carriage with the tiny seats placed extremely high .
&quot; No , Alexey Alexandrovitch !
Unhappiness , almost mental derangement , was visible on his mobile , rather handsome face , while without even noticing Anna &apos;s coming in , he went on hurriedly and hotly expressing his views .
&quot; Don &apos;t speak , don &apos;t say a word !
Putting his elbows on the table , he bent his head on one side , thought a minute , and began to write , without pausing for a second .
But what of it ? &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t be married without it . &quot; &quot; _ Aïe , aïe , aïe ! _ &quot; cried Levin .
I &apos;ve scribbled all over the table ! &quot; she said , and , laying down the chalk , she made a movement as though to get up .
Where did you meet Alexey Alexandrovitch ? &quot; Her voice sounded in an unnatural and jarring tone .
I go there every year shooting , and your forest &apos;s worth a hundred and fifty roubles an acre paid down , while he &apos;s giving you sixty by installments .
Levin &apos;s conviction that it could not be was founded on the idea that in the eyes of her family he was a disadvantageous and worthless match for the charming Kitty , and that Kitty herself could not love him .
&quot; I cannot in any case agree with Keiss that my whole conception of the external world has been derived from perceptions .
The ploughland was in splendid condition ; in a couple of days it would be fit for harrowing and sowing .
But it appeared that as the paddock had not been used during the winter , the hurdles made in the autumn for it were broken .
Over the ploughland riding was utterly impossible ; the horse could only keep a foothold where there was ice , and in the thawing furrows he sank deep in at each step .
They &apos;ve conquered everybody , and why am I to be pleased at that ?
&quot; No , we &apos;ve been hunting in the Tver province .
Oh , oh !
He knew she was there by the rapture and the terror that seized on his heart .
And at the confectioner &apos;s , and at Fomin &apos;s , and at Foulde &apos;s he saw that he was expected ; that they were pleased to see him , and prided themselves on his happiness , just as everyone whom he had to do with during those days .
That &apos;s why she &apos;s being married to him . &quot; &quot; No , they &apos;re a well @-@ matched pair . &quot; &quot; I say , Marya Vassilievna , you were making out those fly @-@ away crinolines were not being worn .
&quot; What nonsense ! &quot; thought Vronsky , and glanced at his watch .
What &apos;s the matter ? &quot; &quot; She writes to me that Nikolay , my brother , is at death &apos;s door .
&quot; I heard the name Vronsky , but I didn &apos;t know which one .
And at dinner they inquire who lives at the top in that house .
That &apos;s Ryabinin &apos;s way of doing business ; he doesn &apos;t haggle over every half @-@ penny , &quot; he added , scowling and waving the pocketbook .
&quot; Ah !
&quot; I think , &quot; said Anna , playing with the glove she had taken off , &quot; I think ... of so many men , so many minds , certainly so many hearts , so many kinds of love . &quot; Vronsky was gazing at Anna , and with a fainting heart waiting for what she would say .
&quot; They say if anyone &apos;s best man more than ten times , he &apos;ll never be married .
Stremov , carrying with him several members , went over to Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s side , and not contenting himself with warmly defending the measure proposed by Karenin , proposed other more extreme measures in the same direction .
But still he had that look Levin knew so well that always irritated him , a look of hopelessness and despondency .
It &apos;s so horrible to talk about it . &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t , &quot; said her mother , seeing the tears in her daughter &apos;s eyes ; &quot; but one thing , my love ; you promised me you would have no secrets from me .
And having obtained permission , Alexey Alexandrovitch prepared to set off to these remote provinces .
&quot; It &apos;s the end . &quot; Marya Nikolaevna went up to him .
&quot; Let him wait .
Anna got up too .
&quot; Well , but you yourself , Yegor , when you got married , did you love your wife ? &quot; &quot; Ay !
The celebrated doctor announced to the princess ( a feeling of what was due from him dictated his doing so ) that he ought to see the patient once more .
Bowing her head , she greeted Alexey Alexandrovitch with an ironical smile .
Everything would be done of itself .
That fellow ( Golenishtchev ) was a Russian living here .
The landlord and the servants , too , grew brisker under the influence of his good spirits .
He was sealing the envelope to the lawyer , when he heard the loud tones of Stepan Arkadyevitch &apos;s voice .
Without the slightest change in her action his mare flew over it ; the palings vanished , and he heard only a crash behind him .
But her eyes said that she knew he had a heart , and that was why she was afraid of him .
Isn &apos;t he a splendid fellow ?
Well , Kondraty will take you in the carriage , while I go to my committee .
This time Seryozha was not at home , and she was completely alone .
He knew this with certainty , as so @-@ called eligible young men always know it , though he could never have brought himself to speak of it to anyone ; and he knew too that , although he wanted to get married , and although by every token this very attractive girl would make an excellent wife , he could no more have married her , even if he had not been in love with Kitty Shtcherbatskaya , than he could have flown up to the sky .
&quot; How unlucky !
&quot; Yes , I see it all more and more clearly , &quot; she went on musingly .
This government clerk won &apos;t let it drop , he &apos;ll go on with the thing . &quot; Vronsky saw all the thanklessness of the business , and that there could be no question of a duel in it , that everything must be done to soften the government clerk , and hush the matter up .
&quot; They pounce on the idea , and distort it , and then work it out so pettily and unworthily .
I am awfully , awfully sorry for her .
I maintain that .... &quot; &quot; Couldn &apos;t we ask him to paint a portrait of Anna Arkadyevna ? &quot; said Vronsky .
But he had promised Bryansky to come , and so he decided to drive on , telling the coachman not to spare the horses .
I &apos;m in favor of division of labor .
She would not regard the slightest request - that she should observe decorum , &quot; he said , getting heated .
&quot; You don &apos;t admit , I know , that one can be fond of new rolls when one has had one &apos;s rations of bread - to your mind it &apos;s a crime ; but I don &apos;t count life as life without love , &quot; he said , taking Levin &apos;s question his own way .
For a man with one hundred thousand roubles of revenue , which was what everyone fixed as Vronsky &apos;s income , such debts , one would suppose , could hardly be embarrassing ; but the fact was that he was far from having one hundred thousand .
A little man in spectacles , with a narrow forehead , tore himself from the discussion for an instant to greet Levin , and then went on talking without paying any further attention to him .
However , I &apos;m not saying so much what I think , as what I feel .
On seeing her husband , Anna raised her head and smiled , as though she had just waked up .
When he saw Agafea Mihalovna , he made jokes with her and asked after the old servants .
&quot; I imagine one cannot exonerate such a man from blame , though he is your brother , &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch severely .
&quot; I think so too , Alexey Alexandrovitch . &quot; &quot; Then why didn &apos;t you say so ? &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s one to say it to ?
&quot; Never mind , he &apos;ll get on all right , &quot; the old man resumed .
Have you seen the new helmets ?
He demanded the appointment of another special commission to inquire into the question of the Native Tribes Organization Committee .
But Vronsky gazed at him exactly as he did at the lamp , and the young man made a wry face , feeling that he was losing his self @-@ possession under the oppression of this refusal to recognize him as a person .
Cord , in honor of the races , had put on his best clothes , a black coat buttoned up , a stiffly starched collar , which propped up his cheeks , a round black hat , and top boots .
I must tell you ... no , you . &quot; she turned to Alexey Alexandrovitch , and her neck and brow were suffused with crimson .
She looked altogether , except across the shoulders , as it were , pinched in at the sides and pressed out in depth .
It cheers us up to work under the master &apos;s eye .... &quot; &quot; So they &apos;re sowing clover behind the Birch Dale ?
The prince frowned and coughed , listening to the doctor .
It was as if darkness had swooped down upon her life ; she felt that these children of hers , that she was so proud of , were not merely most ordinary , but positively bad , ill @-@ bred children , with coarse , brutal propensities - wicked children .
&quot; I want to move Anna downstairs , but we must hang up blinds .
Two trunks , some bags and strapped @-@ up rugs , had been carried down into the hall .
I didn &apos;t pick it up on the ground , nor steal it either . &quot; &quot; Mercy on us !
Only it &apos;s a work to get about !
But she could not grieve her mother , especially as her mother considered herself to blame .
She opened the door and went out .
What is the matter ?
Although her dress , her coiffure , and all the preparations for the ball had cost Kitty great trouble and consideration , at this moment she walked into the ballroom in her elaborate tulle dress over a pink slip as easily and simply as though all the rosettes and lace , all the minute details of her attire , had not cost her or her family a moment &apos;s attention , as though she had been born in that tulle and lace , with her hair done up high on her head , and a rose and two leaves on the top of it .
A roar of delighted shrieks arose in the nursery , and never ceased till they had set off for the bathing @-@ place .
He knew that his sole means of security against people was to hide his wounds from them , and instinctively he tried to do this for two days , but now he felt incapable of keeping up the unequal struggle .
A sledge and a carriage with the coachman asleep stood at the entrance .
Levin looked about him and hardly recognized the place , everything was so changed .
&quot; Everything .
Dolly did not shrink away , but her face did not lose its frigid expression .
And in spite of the fact that science , art , and politics had no special interest for him , he firmly held those views on all these subjects which were held by the majority and by his paper , and he only changed them when the majority changed them - or , more strictly speaking , he did not change them , but they imperceptibly changed of themselves within him .
So they mowed the first row .
What am I to do ?
She saw that Alexey Alexandrovitch wanted to tell her something pleasant to him about it , and she brought him by questions to telling it .
It &apos;s simply that I haven &apos;t the time . &quot; &quot; No ; you don &apos;t care , perhaps , to meet Stremov ?
The priest was the same old man that had confessed Levin .
Just because they see that this is something they can &apos;t understand .
He had not seen Kitty since that memorable evening when he met Vronsky , not counting , that is , the moment when he had had a glimpse of her on the highroad .
Venus had risen above the branch , and the ear of the Great Bear with its shaft was now all plainly visible against the dark blue sky , yet still he waited .
Chapter 9 On the drive home , as Darya Alexandrovna , with all her children round her , their heads still wet from their bath , and a kerchief tied over her own head , was getting near the house , the coachman said , &quot; There &apos;s some gentleman coming : the master of Pokrovskoe , I do believe . &quot; Darya Alexandrovna peeped out in front , and was delighted when she recognized in the gray hat and gray coat the familiar figure of Levin walking to meet them .
Stremov was a man of fifty , partly gray , but still vigorous @-@ looking , very ugly , but with a characteristic and intelligent face .
&quot; How are you feeling today ? &quot; she asked Petrov .
He &apos;s such a true , honest nature , and a heart of gold .
I know him ; I know that he &apos;s at home and is happy in deceit , like a fish swimming in the water .
There , that &apos;s capital .
She had no doubt that she had acted rightly .
To all these questions there were answers admirably stated , and answers admitting no shade of doubt , since they were not a product of human thought , always liable to error , but were all the product of official activity .
She was , every time she saw him , making the picture of him in her imagination ( incomparably superior , impossible in reality ) fit with him as he really was .
But he had not taken into account the ocean of kindliness brimming over in the heart of Stepan Arkadyevitch .
I can &apos;t be at peace , when you can &apos;t be at peace .... &quot; &quot; I ? &quot; she repeated .
The peasants gathered into groups - those further away under a cart , those nearer under a willow bush .
But she &apos;s utterly unmoved by it .
On the writing @-@ table was a stand of drawers marked with gold lettering , and full of papers of various sorts .
&quot; Very glad to make your acquaintance , &quot; she said to the prince .
At that instant Vronsky came up .
Then they began to look more and more often towards the door , and to talk of whether anything could have happened .
Anna answered a few words , but not foreseeing any entertainment from the conversation , she asked Annushka to get a lamp , hooked it onto the arm of her seat , and took from her bag a paper @-@ knife and an English novel .
&quot; Worse , &quot; he articulated with difficulty .
They walked to the house they had taken , and looked over it .
Chapter 16 The princess sat in her armchair , silent and smiling ; the prince sat down beside her .
Not a single merchant ever buys a forest without counting the trees , unless they get it given them for nothing , as you &apos;re doing now .
&quot; Christ before Pilate .
After a little subdued and dejected conversation with his mother @-@ in @-@ law , he threw out his chest again , and put his arm in Levin &apos;s .
&quot; She &apos;s just the same , &quot; replied the prince .
Anxious to show his independence and to advance , he had refused a post that had been offered him , hoping that this refusal would heighten his value ; but it turned out that he had been too bold , and he was passed over .
She thought : &quot; Love ?
But Kitty did not expect much from the quadrille .
She was right , for Levin actually could not bear her , and despised her for what she was proud of and regarded as a fine characteristic - her nervousness , her delicate contempt and indifference for everything coarse and earthly .
With enjoyment she drew deep breaths of the frozen , snowy air , and standing near the carriage looked about the platform and the lighted station .
&quot; I am very glad you have come , &quot; he said , sitting down beside her , and obviously wishing to say something , he stuttered .
&quot; There &apos;s some sense in that , anyway . &quot; Vronsky looked wonderingly at the prince with his resolute eyes , and , with a faint smile , began immediately talking to Countess Nordston of the great ball that was to come off next week .
&quot; Tell me everything . &quot; &quot; Is there hope ? &quot; she meant to say , but her lips quivered , and she could not utter the question .
And from the bedroom door he turned back again ; but as he entered the dark drawing @-@ room some inner voice told him that it was not so , and that if others noticed it that showed that there was something .
Of Mademoiselle Varenka one would not say that she had passed her first youth , but she was , as it were , a creature without youth ; she might have been taken for nineteen or for thirty .
At that moment there walked into the room the tall and well @-@ built Captain Yashvin .
A crowd gathered about them .
If she were divorced , he knew she would join her life to Vronsky &apos;s , and their tie would be an illegitimate and criminal one , since a wife , by the interpretation of the ecclesiastical law , could not marry while her husband was living .
The Society of the Little Sisters &quot; ( this was a religiously @-@ patriotic , philanthropic institution ) &quot; was going splendidly , but with these gentlemen it &apos;s impossible to do anything , &quot; added Countess Lidia Ivanovna in a tone of ironical submission to destiny .
It is absolutely necessary to put an end &quot; - he looked round as he spoke - &quot; to the deception in which we are living . &quot; &quot; Put an end ?
Without conscious intention he began to clutch at every passing caprice , taking it for a desire and an object .
&quot; You can &apos;t conceive how queer it all seems to a country person like me , as queer as that gentleman &apos;s nails I saw at your place .... &quot; &quot; Yes , I saw how much interested you were in poor Grinevitch &apos;s nails , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , laughing .
I know all the baseness , all the horror of my position ; but it &apos;s not so easy to arrange as you think .
&quot; I &apos;ve nothing to grieve over and be comforted about .
&quot; Well now , good @-@ bye , or you &apos;ll never get washed , and I shall have on my conscience the worst sin a gentleman can commit .
In fact , if you do me the honor to intrust your confidence to me , you will do well to leave me the choice of the measures to be employed .
When she thought of her son , and his future attitude to his mother , who had abandoned his father , she felt such terror at what she had done , that she could not face it ; but , like a woman , could only try to comfort herself with lying assurances that everything would remain as it always had been , and that it was possible to forget the fearful question of how it would be with her son .
He never changed his opinion of the peasantry and his sympathetic attitude towards them .
You &apos;ve made a mistake .
A few weeks before , Konstantin Levin had written to his brother that through the sale of the small part of the property , that had remained undivided , there was a sum of about two thousand roubles to come to him as his share .
&quot; But how I remember your jeers ! &quot; continued Princess Betsy , who took a peculiar pleasure in following up this passion to a successful issue .
Vronsky , against his own will or wishes , followed her lead , hoped too that something , apart from his own action , would be sure to solve all difficulties .
&quot; Why not ?
She did not want him now to say what was untrue .
&quot; You &apos;d better ask them , &quot; she brought out , between tears of laughter .
The only thing to be done is to make the best of the position . &quot; And he began passing in review the methods of proceeding of men who had been in the same position that he was in .
When Vassily came up , Levin told him to lead the horse to the hedge .
But she made a favorable impression on Anna Arkadyevna - she saw that at once .
He went into his study to see the people waiting for him with petitions , and to sign some papers brought him by his chief secretary .
&quot; No , I don &apos;t .
Towards night the sick man was not able to lift his hands , and could only gaze before him with the same intensely concentrated expression in his eyes .
&quot; Very well , &quot; she said , and as soon as he had left the room she tore open the letter with trembling fingers .
The sight of tears threw him into a state of nervous agitation , and he utterly lost all power of reflection .
Levin and other men like him , though they could have said a great deal about death , obviously did not know this since they were afraid of death , and were absolutely at a loss what to do when people were dying .
But of late new inner relations had arisen between him and her , which frightened Vronsky by their indefiniteness .
He was vaguely aware that its defects , inconspicuous at first , would be glaring if he were to go on with it .
We are traveling together .
What is freedom for ?
&quot; Possibly the people who are not of our set are even more bored ; but we - I certainly - are not happy , but awfully , awfully bored . &quot; Sappho smoking a cigarette went off into the garden with the two young men .
One joint cracked .
How are you , _ mon cher ? _ &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , as conspicuously brilliant in the midst of all the Petersburg brilliance as he was in Moscow , his face rosy , and his whiskers sleek and glossy .
I know , of course , &quot; Levin added laughing , &quot; you always want to do with as little and as poor quality as possible ; but this year I &apos;m not going to let you have things your own way .
He frowned and seemed ready to cry .
Have work and the necessity of work ?
But immediately as though slipping his feet into old slippers , he dropped back into the light @-@ hearted , pleasant world he had always lived in .
In the first place he resolved that from that day he would give up hoping for any extraordinary happiness , such as marriage must have given him , and consequently he would not so disdain what he really had .
&quot; For Grisha ? &quot; said the little girl , pointing to the chocolate .
Never !
I &apos;m still the same ....
&quot; May I trouble you to sit down , princess ? &quot; the celebrated doctor said to her .
&quot; I &apos;ve come from Gritsky &apos;s &quot; ( that was what they called the colonel ) ; &quot; they &apos;re expecting you . &quot; Vronsky , without answering , looked at his comrade , thinking of something else .
He so well knew that feeling of Levin &apos;s , that for him all the girls in the world were divided into two classes : one class - all the girls in the world except her , and those girls with all sorts of human weaknesses , and very ordinary girls : the other class - she alone , having no weaknesses of any sort and higher than all humanity .
Meantime , as he listened to the usual report , he had the most innocent and inoffensive air .
All right , then we must have it alone .
What are you ?
&quot; What makes you suppose I know ? &quot; &quot; Because everybody knows it .... &quot; &quot; That &apos;s just where you are mistaken ; I did not know it , though I had guessed it was so . &quot; &quot; Well , now you know it . &quot; &quot; All I knew was that something had happened that made her dreadfully miserable , and that she begged me never to speak of it .
&quot; You must knock it down a bit , prince .
For a time after joining his life to hers , and putting on civilian dress , he had felt all the delight of freedom in general of which he had known nothing before , and of freedom in his love , - and he was content , but not for long .
Only I hope you won &apos;t shoot yourself by accident any more , &quot; she said , with a questioning smile .
You took fright at the sight of your rival .
There was the sound of a carriage driving up to the front door .
I attach particular significance to compliance .... &quot; she read .
But I wanted to see you , &quot; said Levin , looking with hatred at Grinevitch &apos;s hand .
Vronsky went up to Kitty reminding her of the first quadrille , and expressing his regret that he had not seen her all this time .
&quot; In what are we to make higher development consist ?
mother ! &quot; Running up to her , he hung on her neck .
When he had finished them he bowed down to the ground and turned , facing Levin .
And there came over Levin a new feeling of love for this man , till then so little known to him , when he saw how slowly and tenderly Kitty kissed his muscular hand .
&quot; Yes ; I used to teach in it myself , and do teach still , but we have a first @-@ rate schoolmistress now .
Do you know who this is ? &quot; he said , addressing his brother , and indicating the gentleman in the jerkin : &quot; This is Mr. Kritsky , my friend from Kiev , a very remarkable man .
I know all about it .
He remained in the little ring of men , taking part in the general conversation , and without looking at Kitty , he was aware of her movements , her looks , and the place where she was in the drawing @-@ room .
Yes , I am ; but besides , all this bothers me , &quot; he said .
He was sitting at the writing @-@ table in his study , writing .
How long .... &quot; &quot; She is quite well , &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch mumbled , frowning .
He saw in the foreground Pilate &apos;s irritated face and the serene face of Christ , and in the background the figures of Pilate &apos;s retinue and the face of John watching what was happening .
&quot; If you love me , as you say , &quot; she whispered , &quot; do so that I may be at peace . &quot; His face grew radiant .
His mother had been in her youth a brilliant society woman , who had had during her married life , and still more afterwards , many love affairs notorious in the whole fashionable world .
I believe I &apos;m not jealous .
&quot; Why don &apos;t you get married ? &quot; &quot; It hasn &apos;t happened so , &quot; Konstantin answered , reddening a little .
In addition to his farming , which called for special attention in spring , and in addition to reading , Levin had begun that winter a work on agriculture , the plan of which turned on taking into account the character of the laborer on the land as one of the unalterable data of the question , like the climate and the soil , and consequently deducing all the principles of scientific culture , not simply from the data of soil and climate , but from the data of soil , climate , and a certain unalterable character of the laborer .
&quot; It is extremely difficult to be mistaken when a wife herself informs her husband of the fact - informs him that eight years of her life , and a son , all that &apos;s a mistake , and that she wants to begin life again , &quot; he said angrily , with a snort .
A silence followed .
Everything is so clear in you . &quot; &quot; I have ! &quot; said Anna suddenly , and , unexpectedly after her tears , a sly , ironical smile curved her lips .
In the morning she had regretted that she had spoken to her husband , and wished for nothing so much as that those words could be unspoken .
&quot; I can &apos;t agree even , &quot; said he , &quot; that the government had that aim .
Chapter 21 From the moment when Alexey Alexandrovitch understood from his interviews with Betsy and with Stepan Arkadyevitch that all that was expected of him was to leave his wife in peace , without burdening her with his presence , and that his wife herself desired this , he felt so distraught that he could come to no decision of himself ; he did not know himself what he wanted now , and putting himself in the hands of those who were so pleased to interest themselves in his affairs , he met everything with unqualified assent .
The cattle @-@ yard , the garden , hay fields , and arable land , divided into several parts , had to be made into separate lots .
She knew that he said that simply to show that family considerations could not prevent him from expressing his genuine opinion .
&quot; Am I worse than other people , or better ?
&quot; I wonder why they had the wedding in the evening ?
Don &apos;t get angry .
a sham !
Vronsky would never have expected to be so pleased to see Golenishtchev , but probably he was not himself aware how bored he was .
Alexey Alexandrovitch made it a rule to see his wife every day , so that the servants might have no grounds for suppositions , but avoided dining at home .
&quot; He &apos;s just one of those people of whom they say they &apos;re not for this world . &quot; &quot; But we have many days before us ; we must go to bed , &quot; said Kitty , glancing at her tiny watch .
&quot; In the village of Vozdrem , Kazan government . &quot; &quot; But why in a village ?
I am so worried today . &quot; &quot; Oh , why ? &quot; asked Anna , trying to suppress a smile .
&quot; Ah !
Stepan Arkadyevitch , always charming , understanding everything at the slightest reference , was particularly charming on this visit , and Levin noticed in him a special tenderness , as it were , and a new tone of respect that flattered him .
&quot; I must own I felt so well content yesterday after the Shtcherbatskys &quot; that I didn &apos;t care to go anywhere . &quot; &quot; I know a gallant steed by tokens sure , And by his eyes I know a youth in love , &quot; declaimed Stepan Arkadyevitch , just as he had done before to Levin .
PART FIVE Chapter 1 Princess Shtcherbatskaya considered that it was out of the question for the wedding to take place before Lent , just five weeks off , since not half the trousseau could possibly be ready by that time .
&quot; I cannot be unhappy , but neither she nor he ought to be happy . &quot; The feeling of jealousy , which had tortured him during the period of uncertainty , had passed away at the instant when the tooth had been with agony extracted by his wife &apos;s words .
&quot; Very well , and I &apos;ll tell her to tidy up here .
And so Liberalism had become a habit of Stepan Arkadyevitch &apos;s , and he liked his newspaper , as he did his cigar after dinner , for the slight fog it diffused in his brain .
Things are in a bad way with me , very bad .
To send you a bottle of Lafitte and roast turkey out there would be a little awkward . &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;ll simply come home at the time of their noonday rest . &quot; Next morning Konstantin Levin got up earlier than usual , but he was detained giving directions on the farm , and when he reached the mowing grass the mowers were already at their second row .
Two men , her husband and her lover , were the two centers of her existence , and unaided by her external senses she was aware of their nearness .
Look what I &apos;ve said , will that persuade him ?
But neither of them dared to speak of it , and so whatever they said - not uttering the one thought that filled their minds - was all falsehood .
In a gentleman &apos;s house it &apos;s easier ; but then here one makes more . &quot; It appeared that Yegor had a family , three boys and a daughter , a sempstress , whom he wanted to marry to a cashier in a saddler &apos;s shop .
&quot; Ah , to be sure , let me introduce you , &quot; he said .
Wonderful !
She utterly lost her head .
But did you send for some new milk ? &quot; And Darya Alexandrovna plunged into the duties of the day , and drowned her grief in them for a time .
&quot; I didn &apos;t expect you !
&quot; Oh , no , stay a bit ! &quot; said Levin , keeping him .
There was a look of horror on her face when she saw them alone , and their disturbed faces .
Why , surely you &apos;re a member of the board ? &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m not a member now ; I &apos;ve resigned , &quot; answered Levin , &quot; and I no longer attend the meetings . &quot; &quot; What a pity ! &quot; commented Sergey Ivanovitch , frowning .
The impulsive abruptness of her movements was such that at every step the lines of her knees and the upper part of her legs were distinctly marked under her dress , and the question involuntarily rose to the mind where in the undulating , piled @-@ up mountain of material at the back the real body of the woman , so small and slender , so naked in front , and so hidden behind and below , really came to an end .
For the first time the question presented itself to him of the possibility of his wife &apos;s loving someone else , and he was horrified at it .
Kritsky got up deliberately and reached his cap .
But though he was taking a holiday now , that is to say , he was doing no writing , he was so used to intellectual activity that he liked to put into concise and eloquent shape the ideas that occurred to him , and liked to have someone to listen to him .
But from time to time he rubbed his high forehead and shook his head , as though to drive away something .
I &apos;ll see to everything myself . &quot; &quot; Why , I don &apos;t think you take much rest as it is .
&quot; He does not improve on closer acquaintance .
I shan &apos;t be in your way .
Why was it you did not come to see us nor them when you were in Moscow ? &quot; &quot; Darya Alexandrovna , &quot; he said , blushing up to the roots of his hair , &quot; I wonder really that with your kind heart you don &apos;t feel this .
Levin knew that those words meant , &quot; You see , and you know , that I &apos;m in a bad way , and maybe we shall not see each other again . &quot; Levin knew this , and the tears gushed from his eyes .
In everything he said , thought , and did , she saw something particularly noble and elevated .
If her illness was a trick , he would say nothing and go away again .
A moment later he peeped out thence and beckoned to Levin .
a sham ! ... &quot; &quot; A sham !
When returning from the races Anna had informed him of her relations with Vronsky , and immediately afterwards had burst into tears , hiding her face in her hands , Alexey Alexandrovitch , for all the fury aroused in him against her , was aware at the same time of a rush of that emotional disturbance always produced in him by tears .
&quot; If you prefer it , your excellency , a private room will be free directly ; Prince Golistin with a lady .
Within three months a report was presented .
&quot; By such a course only shall I be acting in accordance with the dictates of religion , &quot; he told himself .
He &apos;s a saint , &quot; she said .
And all at once every hope vanished in those about him and in himself .
Nothing was to be heard but the night sounds of the frogs that never ceased in the marsh , and the horses snorting in the mist that rose over the meadow before the morning .
She knew that he usually went out quickly to his office , and she wanted to see him before that , so that their attitude to one another might be defined .
&quot; You must understand that for me to see you , and not to see him , is far more painful .
She had not the least idea what would settle the position , but she firmly believed that something would very soon turn up now .
Alexey Alexandrovitch goes to the council at seven and will be there till ten . &quot; Thinking for an instant of the strangeness of her bidding him come straight to her , in spite of her husband &apos;s insisting on her not receiving him , he decided to go .
No one , looking at his white hands , with their swollen veins and long fingers , so softly stroking the edges of the white paper that lay before him , and at the air of weariness with which his head drooped on one side , would have suspected that in a few minutes a torrent of words would flow from his lips that would arouse a fearful storm , set the members shouting and attacking one another , and force the president to call for order .
The expression of her face instantaneously changed .
Will you leave him to the allurements of the world and the devil ?
how sleepy I am , unluckily , &quot; she said , rapidly passing her hand through her hair , feeling for the remaining hairpins .
&quot; We all drove back to my place after the races .
Ah , here it is , &quot; he said , seeing a waiter with a tray .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand him in the least , &quot; said Vronsky .
&quot; Yes , I should .
The morning spent at Princess Tverskaya &apos;s had confirmed her still more in this .
&quot; Thank you , &quot; she added , as he picked up the handkerchief that had fallen out of her muff .
He sat down himself , and , rubbing his little hands with short fingers covered with white hairs , he bent his head on one side .
&quot; And what right had he to look at him like that ? &quot; thought Anna , recalling Vronsky &apos;s glance at Alexey Alexandrovitch .
I consider jealousy , as you know , a humiliating and degrading feeling , and I shall never allow myself to be influenced by it ; but there are certain rules of decorum which cannot be disregarded with impunity .
Alexey Alexandrovitch was standing face to face with life , with the possibility of his wife &apos;s loving someone other than himself , and this seemed to him very irrational and incomprehensible because it was life itself .
From the billiard room next door came the sound of balls knocking , of talk and laughter .
I understand you : I understand that you can &apos;t take it on yourself to express your wishes , your feelings . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s nothing , nothing I wish ... except for it to be all over . &quot; &quot; But he sees this and knows it .
The next song in the book was an Italian one .
All that night and morning Levin lived perfectly unconsciously , and felt perfectly lifted out of the conditions of material life .
Stepan Arkadyevitch was silent a minute .
No , I won &apos;t give him that happiness .
Venden himself , on returning from his office , heard a ring at their bell and voices , went out , and seeing the intoxicated officers with a letter , he had turned them out .
&quot; Why out of the question ?
Only , those German quacks are mischievous ....
They both sat down in the bathroom on a lounge , and a conversation began which was very interesting to both of them .
They were fond of one another in spite of the difference of their characters and tastes , as friends are fond of one another who have been together in early youth .
The perspiration with which he was drenched cooled him , while the sun , that burned his back , his head , and his arms , bare to the elbow , gave a vigor and dogged energy to his labor ; and more and more often now came those moments of unconsciousness , when it was possible not to think what one was doing .
It was a long while before Levin could make out what was expected of him .
At dinner time ( there were always a few people dining with the Karenins ) there arrived an old lady , a cousin of Alexey Alexandrovitch , the chief secretary of the department and his wife , and a young man who had been recommended to Alexey Alexandrovitch for the service .
But , noticing that Kitty only responded to her smile by a look of despair and amazement , she turned away from her , and began gaily talking to the other lady .
She was not worse , but different from what she had fancied her before .
Having finished this business , he wrote a cold and cutting answer to his mother .
The saying of Darya Alexandrovna at Moscow , that in deciding on a divorce he was thinking of himself , and not considering that by this he would be ruining her irrevocably , had sunk into his heart .
His picture of mediæval life he went on with .
But , darling , I &apos;m simply sorry , sorry from my heart for you ! &quot; Under the thick lashes of her shining eyes tears suddenly glittered .
She wanted to be the first to tell him her happiness and his .
When the doctor had gone away the sick man said something to his brother , of which Levin could distinguish only the last words : &quot; Your Katya . &quot; By the expression with which he gazed at her , Levin saw that he was praising her .
&quot; Together we will take care of Seryozha .
To this satisfaction was added the fact that an idea had just struck him for a riddle turning on his successful achievement , that when the affair was over he would ask his wife and most intimate friends .
And then , jealousy means lowering both myself and her , &quot; he told himself as he went into her boudoir ; but this dictum , which had always had such weight with him before , had now no weight and no meaning at all .
The bailiff smiled and said : &quot; Yes , sir . &quot; At tea the same evening Levin said to his brother : &quot; I fancy the fine weather will last .
She was religious , had never doubted the truths of religion , but his external unbelief did not affect her in the least .
She keeps on about you and nothing but you , &quot; she said .
&quot; Yes , time will pass ; time , which arranges all things , and the old relations will be reestablished , &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch told himself ; &quot; so far reestablished , that is , that I shall not be sensible of a break in the continuity of my life .
how is it they don &apos;t put an end to such a hideous position ? &quot; But now , when the misfortune had come upon himself , he was so far from thinking of putting an end to the position that he would not recognize it at all , would not recognize it just because it was too awful , too unnatural .
Mademoiselle Linon had gone away .
I will inform him at once of my position in regard to his sister , and explain why it is I can &apos;t dine with him . &quot; &quot; Come in ! &quot; he said aloud , collecting his papers , and putting them in the blotting @-@ paper .
His attitude to the husband was the clearest of all .
And besides , on that day , as it was the fifteenth , he had to give his wife some money for her expenses , according to their usual arrangement .
Once he dined there , another time he spent the evening there with a party of friends , but he had not once stayed the night there , as it had been his habit to do in previous years .
&quot; Yes , that &apos;s an understood thing , &quot; responded the celebrated physician , again glancing at his watch .
By chance I might have seen her , then everything would have happened of itself ; but , as it is , it &apos;s out of the question , out of the question ! &quot; Darya Alexandrovna sent him a letter , asking him for a side @-@ saddle for Kitty &apos;s use .
Only one .... &quot; Again he knew from her terrified eyes that this one way of escape in her thought was death , and he would not let her say it .
The question how to live had hardly begun to grow a little clearer to him , when a new , insoluble question presented itself - death .
The summer they intended to spend on Vronsky &apos;s great family estate .
With a resolute feeling of hope in a new , better life , he reached home before nine o &apos;clock at night .
Different as those two women were , Agafea Mihalovna and Katya , as his brother Nikolay had called her , and as Levin particularly liked to call her now , they were quite alike in this .
I know , it can &apos;t be forgiven !
And your Varenka catches it too , &quot; he added .
These two passions did not interfere with one another .
Can he be going to stay the night ? &quot; she wondered , and the thought of all that might come of such a chance struck her as so awful and terrible that , without dwelling on it for a moment , she went down to meet him with a bright and radiant face ; and conscious of the presence of that spirit of falsehood and deceit in herself that she had come to know of late , she abandoned herself to that spirit and began talking , hardly knowing what she was saying .
That &apos;s the beginning of a new thing we &apos;re going into .
I shall maybe do some mowing myself too , &quot; he said , trying not to be embarrassed .
But if even that cannot be , command me to disappear , and I disappear .
With the tact of which both had such a large share , they had succeeded in avoiding Russian ladies abroad , and so had never placed themselves in a false position , and everywhere they had met people who pretended that they perfectly understood their position , far better indeed than they did themselves .
Stop a bit , Vronsky .
&quot; Before beginning to speak of my business , &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch , following the lawyer &apos;s movements with wondering eyes , &quot; I ought to observe that the business about which I have to speak to you is to be strictly private . &quot; The lawyer &apos;s overhanging reddish mustaches were parted in a scarcely perceptible smile .
Kitty , too , did not come , sending a note that she had a headache .
Looking at Anna &apos;s manner of simple @-@ hearted , spirited gaiety , and knowing Alexey Alexandrovitch and Vronsky , Golenishtchev fancied that he understood her perfectly .
Why , you did nothing wrong ? &quot; &quot; Worse than wrong - shameful . &quot; Varenka shook her head and laid her hand on Kitty &apos;s hand .
Listen .
As the head of the family , I am a person bound in duty to guide her , and consequently , in part the person responsible ; I am bound to point out the danger I perceive , to warn her , even to use my authority .
But in the little corridor she paused , going over in her imagination what had happened .
She noticed that when questioning her about her family , Madame Stahl had smiled contemptuously , which was not in accord with Christian meekness .
Allow me to believe that apart from our connection you have for me , at least in part , the same friendly feeling I have always had for you ... and sincere esteem , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , pressing his hand .
That &apos;s bad !
Sappho laughed still more festively .
The princess and Kitty beat a hasty retreat , while the colonel joined the crowd to find out what was the matter .
There were two circumstances a little unpleasant , but these two circumstances were drowned in the sea of good @-@ humored gaiety which flooded the soul of Stepan Arkadyevitch .
&quot; My God , my God !
&quot; What , when .... &quot; He coughed and waved his hand .
&quot; It &apos;s just this , &quot; said the doctor , taking a finger of his kid glove in his white hands and pulling it , &quot; if you don &apos;t strain the strings , and then try to break them , you &apos;ll find it a difficult job ; but strain a string to its very utmost , and the mere weight of one finger on the strained string will snap it .
Eh ? &quot; He wanted Levin to be in good spirits .
For my part , anyway , whatever I &apos;ve spent money on in the way of husbandry , it has been a loss : stock - a loss , machinery - a loss . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s true enough , &quot; the gentleman with the gray whiskers chimed in , positively laughing with satisfaction .
Marry a peasant girl ?
&quot; I can say it before my daughter : her hair is long , because her wit is .... &quot; &quot; Just what they thought of the negroes before their emancipation ! &quot; said Pestsov angrily .
&quot; If he would fight , would stand up for his honor , I could act , could express my feelings ; but this weakness or baseness ....
&quot; Kindly consider , &quot; he began , &quot; cases of that kind are , as you are aware , under ecclesiastical jurisdiction ; the reverend fathers are fond of going into the minutest details in cases of that kind , &quot; he said with a smile , which betrayed his sympathy with the reverend fathers &quot; taste .
What &apos;s so awful is that all at once my heart &apos;s turned , and instead of love and tenderness , I have nothing but hatred for him ; yes , hatred .
Oh !
&quot; Excuse me , princess , &quot; he said , smiling courteously but looking her very firmly in the face , &quot; but I see that Anna &apos;s not very well , and I wish her to come home with me . &quot; Anna looked about her in a frightened way , got up submissively , and laid her hand on her husband &apos;s arm .
why ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a long story .
&quot; You got my telegram ?
&quot; There , you see how fidgety she is , &quot; said the Englishman .
This rather spoiled the general good humor .
The maid begged her pardon for coming in , saying that she had fancied the bell rang .
Darya Alexandrovna , in her best gray silk gown , obviously worried about the children , who were to have their dinner by themselves in the nursery , and by her husband &apos;s absence , was not equal to the task of making the party mix without him .
And there &apos;s no harm in it , you know .
&quot; Altogether then , I see your visit was a success , &quot; he said to her .
She said : &quot; To comfort me &apos;s impossible .
He read , too , that Count Beist was rumored to have left for Wiesbaden , and that one need have no more gray hair , and of the sale of a light carriage , and of a young person seeking a situation ; but these items of information did not give him , as usual , a quiet , ironical gratification .
Vronsky had not had time to look at the saddle , about which he had to give some direction , when the competitors were summoned to the pavilion to receive their numbers and places in the row at starting .
If he knew that I think no more of them than of Piotr the cook , &quot; she thought , looking at his head and red neck with a feeling of possession strange to herself .
Chapter 7 Steps were heard at the door , and Princess Betsy , knowing it was Madame Karenina , glanced at Vronsky .
&quot; However , I had finished .... &quot; And the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess , as an exceptionally intelligent woman , the condition of the young princess , and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters , which were certainly harmless .
Alexey Alexandrovitch took no interest in the race , and so he did not watch the racers , but fell listlessly to scanning the spectators with his weary eyes .
&quot; But what of him ? &quot; Kitty looked at him and was filled with terror .
I don &apos;t try to catch them in the least .
&quot; A very remarkable book . &quot; Anna smiled , as people smile at the weaknesses of those they love , and , putting her hand under his , she escorted him to the door of the study .
Why do you say it &apos;s out of the question ? &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;ll be going God knows where , by all sorts of roads and to all sorts of hotels .
Countess Lidia Ivanovna had hinted that this was the best way out of his position , and of late the obtaining of divorces had been brought to such perfection that Alexey Alexandrovitch saw a possibility of overcoming the formal difficulties .
While he was writing his ideas she was thinking how unnaturally cordial her husband had been to young Prince Tcharsky , who had , with great want of tact , flirted with her the day before they left Moscow .
&quot; But what has it to do with me ? &quot; she said to herself , and she began asking her husband how Seryozha had got on without her .
I accept the calamity as an accomplished fact , and am doing my best to help both her and you , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch .
&quot; Ah , how glad I am to see you ! &quot; she said , going up to her .
In the coach was an old lady dozing in one corner , and at the window , evidently only just awake , sat a young girl holding in both hands the ribbons of a white cap .
One of those balls where one always enjoys oneself . &quot; &quot; Why , are there balls where one always enjoys oneself ? &quot; Anna said , with tender irony .
Really , he &apos;s getting quite a man .
spiritualism !
&quot; The coffee is ready , and mademoiselle and Seryozha are waiting , &quot; said Annushka , coming back again and finding Anna in the same position .
Anna had not had time to drink her coffee when the Countess Lidia Ivanovna was announced .
&quot; Time , indeed , that depends !
&quot; Woman desires to have rights , to be independent , educated .
One thing : forgive ....
These fits of jealousy , which of late had been more and more frequent with her , horrified him , and however much he tried to disguise the fact , made him feel cold to her , although he knew the cause of her jealousy was her love for him .
She had refused five partners , and now she was not dancing the mazurka .
&quot; Well , now , on my honor , &quot; said Levin , smiling , &quot; I can &apos;t find in my heart that feeling of regret for my freedom . &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s such a chaos in your heart just now that you can &apos;t find anything there , &quot; said Katavasov .
In the midst of his toil there were moments during which he forgot what he was doing , and it came all easy to him , and at those same moments his row was almost as smooth and well cut as Tit &apos;s .
Alexey Alexandrovitch went into her boudoir .
&quot; They &apos;re getting ready to go away , so I promised to help them pack . &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ll come too , then . &quot; &quot; No , why should you ? &quot; &quot; Why not ?
&quot; Miss Edwarde says that perhaps the wet @-@ nurse has no milk , &quot; he said .
&quot; A little curl , oh yes .
Dolly was crushed by her sorrow , utterly swallowed up by it .
At the steps there stood a trap tightly covered with iron and leather , with a sleek horse tightly harnessed with broad collar @-@ straps .
He heard nothing but the swish of scythes , and saw before him Tit &apos;s upright figure mowing away , the crescent @-@ shaped curve of the cut grass , the grass and flower heads slowly and rhythmically falling before the blade of his scythe , and ahead of him the end of the row , where would come the rest .
&quot; Don &apos;t go away , &quot; said Nikolay and held out his hand .
All his efforts to draw her into open discussion she confronted with a barrier which he could not penetrate , made up of a sort of amused perplexity .
&quot; Kitty plays , and we have a piano ; not a good one , it &apos;s true , but you will give us so much pleasure , &quot; said the princess with her affected smile , which Kitty disliked particularly just then , because she noticed that Varenka had no inclination to sing .
Out of the question ! &quot; he said , looking at the crumpled front of his shirt .
