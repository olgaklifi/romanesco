&quot; - instant of passion ? &quot; he said , and would have gone on , but at that word , as at a pang of physical pain , her lips stiffened again , and again the muscles of her right cheek worked .
And the prince went out of the room .
&quot; Nonsense , Anna Arkadyevna , &quot; said Korsunsky , drawing her bare arm under the sleeve of his dress coat , &quot; I &apos;ve such an idea for a _ cotillion !
Kitty felt that Anna was perfectly simple and was concealing nothing , but that she had another higher world of interests inaccessible to her , complex and poetic .
Isn &apos;t it the life all of you , all young men , always lead ? &quot; she said , knitting her brows ; and taking up the crochet work that was lying on the table , she began drawing the hook out of it , without looking at Vronsky .
Your mother was asleep in the corner .
&quot; Is Seryozha quite well ? &quot; he said , and not waiting for an answer , he added : &quot; I shan &apos;t be dining at home today , and I have got to go out directly . &quot; &quot; I had thought of going to Moscow , &quot; she said .
Vronsky stepped into the carriage .
Chairs were set with the aid of footmen , moving almost imperceptibly about the room ; the party settled itself , divided into two groups : one round the samovar near the hostess , the other at the opposite end of the drawing @-@ room , round the handsome wife of an ambassador , in black velvet , with sharply defined black eyebrows .
The stairs up to her room came out on the landing of the great warm main staircase .
&quot; Stiva !
Try leeches .
The cattle , bald in patches where the new hair had not grown yet , lowed in the pastures ; the bowlegged lambs frisked round their bleating mothers .
From his conversation with the old man , Levin thought he was not averse to new methods either .
Why are the children here ?
&quot; One thing might be said , if you will allow me to make the remark .... &quot; observed Golenishtchev .
Vronsky understood now that this was Madame Karenina .
And she was continually picturing them to herself , at one moment each separately , and then both together .
The old prince , like all fathers indeed , was exceedingly punctilious on the score of the honor and reputation of his daughters .
As she raked together what was left of the hay , the young wife shook off the bits of hay that had fallen on her neck , and straightening the red kerchief that had dropped forward over her white brow , not browned like her face by the sun , she crept under the cart to tie up the load .
&quot; Oh !
&quot; I &apos;ve tried it .
Directly the servant had set the tea and left the room , Alexey Alexandrovitch got up and went to the writing @-@ table .
And then all at once love turns up , and you &apos;re done for , done for , &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch said with weary despair .
She dressed quickly , went downstairs , and with resolute steps walked into the drawing @-@ room , where she found , as usual , waiting for her , the coffee , Seryozha , and his governess .
The other confession set her weeping bitterly .
Why she said this , which she had not thought of a second before , she could not have explained .
&quot; Here , if you please , &quot; he said , moving on one side with his nimble gait and pointing to his picture , &quot; it &apos;s the exhortation to Pilate .
&quot; I am dying ; I beg , I implore you to come .
Some supernatural force drew Kitty &apos;s eyes to Anna &apos;s face .
&quot; Well , I have had some today already , &quot; said the old man , obviously accepting the invitation with pleasure .
The high grass softly turned about the wheels and the horse &apos;s legs , leaving its seeds clinging to the wet axles and spokes of the wheels .
For the first moment only , Vronsky was startled after the impression of a quite different world that he had brought with him from Moscow .
&quot; However , we can go into that later . &quot; &quot; Yes , later .
Moreover , Levin knew that at Sviazhsky &apos;s he should meet the landowners of the neighborhood , and it was particularly interesting for him just now to hear and take part in those rural conversations concerning crops , laborers &quot; wages , and so on , which , he was aware , are conventionally regarded as something very low , but which seemed to him just now to constitute the one subject of importance .
She was listening to the stirring of the new life within her .
He felt himself a king , not because he believed that he had made an impression on Anna - he did not yet believe that , - but because the impression she had made on him gave him happiness and pride .
As Serpuhovskoy came down the steps he saw Vronsky .
&quot; Well , what am I going to do ?
To talk of outside things seemed to him shocking , impossible , to talk of death and depressing subjects - also impossible .
There are people , on the other hand , who desire above all to find in that lucky rival the qualities by which he has outstripped them , and seek with a throbbing ache at heart only what is good .
It was all common , poor , and stale , and positively badly painted - weak and unequal .
Permanent hands , day @-@ laborers , rammers - you can &apos;t get out of those forms . &quot; &quot; But Europe is dissatisfied with these forms . &quot; &quot; Dissatisfied , and seeking new ones .
&quot; A priceless man ! &quot; said the Countess Lidia Ivanovna .
There are people who , on meeting a successful rival , no matter in what , are at once disposed to turn their backs on everything good in him , and to see only what is bad .
It was revealed to her that besides the instinctive life to which Kitty had given herself up hitherto there was a spiritual life .
&quot; In what way ? &quot; &quot; Some peaches were lying on the table in the corner room .
He knows all about it , he sees it all ; what does he care if he can talk so calmly ?
His brother Sergey Ivanovitch , Stepan Arkadyevitch , and the princess guided him in doing what he had to do .
He did not understand how his pity for her exasperated her .
The government clerk lodges a complaint , and I became a mediator , and such a mediator ! ...
&quot; Define what it is you find .... &quot; &quot; Pardon , let me say all I have to say .
&quot; I gave that life up long ago , &quot; said he , wondering at the change in her face , and trying to divine its meaning .
&quot; Ah ! &quot; he began joyously .
Seryozha had been caught by the rain in the big garden , and he and his nurse had taken shelter in an arbor .
&quot; Shall you be long in Moscow ?
&quot; Anyone who likes amalgamating is welcome to it , but it sickens me . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re a regular reactionist , I see . &quot; &quot; Really , I have never considered what I am .
&quot; I &apos;m no judge , of course .
Nothing .
&quot; Sure to be someone with papers for me , &quot; put in Stepan Arkadyevitch .
He would clearly have died sooner than own it was hard work for him .
He gets something from the Academy , &quot; she went on briskly , trying to drown the distress that the queer change in Anna Pavlovna &apos;s manner to her had aroused in her .
You must settle with him , Konstantin Dmitrievitch , &quot; said the bailiff .
&quot; Not going at all ? &quot; &quot; No ; don &apos;t unpack till tomorrow , and let the carriage wait .
Through the frosty vapor could be seen workmen in short sheepskins and soft felt boots crossing the rails of the curving line .
But truly , truly , it &apos;s not my fault , or only my fault a little bit , &quot; she said , daintily drawling the words &quot; a little bit . &quot; &quot; Oh , how like Stiva you said that ! &quot; said Dolly , laughing .
&quot; No , I don &apos;t smoke , &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch answered calmly , and as though purposely wishing to show that he was not afraid of the subject , he turned to Pestsov with a chilly smile .
The money is ready conclusively to the last farthing .
&quot; Yes , but you must care to say good @-@ bye to a man who has shot himself on your account .... &quot; &quot; That &apos;s just why I don &apos;t want to . &quot; With a dismayed and guilty expression , Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped and would have gone back unobserved .
He feels it , that &apos;s evident . &quot; &quot; He ? &quot; she said sneeringly .
But , contrary to his usual habit , he did not go to bed , he walked up and down his study till three o &apos;clock in the morning .
Levin knew all this ; and it was agonizingly painful to him to behold the supplicating , hopeful eyes and the emaciated wrist , lifted with difficulty , making the sign of the cross on the tense brow , and the prominent shoulders and hollow , gasping chest , which one could not feel consistent with the life the sick man was praying for .
&quot; You won &apos;t dine at home ? &quot; said Matvey , seeing him off .
&quot; Oh !
&quot; Well , what is it , Matrona ? &quot; queried Stepan Arkadyevitch , going up to her at the door .
And with these memories was now ranged his rejection and the pitiful position in which he must have appeared to others that evening .
Again and again she went over in her memory all her relations with the family .
The efforts she had made to like it seemed to her intolerable , and she felt a longing to get back quickly into the fresh air , to Russia , to Ergushovo , where , as she knew from letters , her sister Dolly had already gone with her children .
Two were already riding forward to the point from which they were to start .
Linon , and looked towards him with a smile of quiet affection , as though he were a favorite brother .
Hi , wine ! &quot; he shouted , in his rich voice , that always rang out so loudly at drill , and set the windows shaking now .
Shake hands on it . &quot; And the baroness , detaining Vronsky , began telling him , with many jokes , about her last new plans of life , asking his advice .
Just now , when Levin , under the influence of the thoughts that had come to him , and Agafea Mihalovna &apos;s hint , was in a troubled and uncertain humor , the meeting with his brother that he had to face seemed particularly difficult .
&quot; Give him your hand .
&quot; No ; why , as it is , I have danced more at your ball in Moscow than I have all the winter in Petersburg , &quot; said Anna , looking round at Vronsky , who stood near her .
The trifling fact that , thinning out his rye , the old man used the rye he thinned out for his horses , specially struck Levin .
Oh , it is nice , delicious !
&quot; You want it , I expect ? &quot; &quot; No , I don &apos;t ... yes , I do , &quot; she said , not looking at him , and crimsoning to the roots of her hair .
&quot; Yes , but what is a girl to do who has no family ? &quot; put in Stepan Arkadyevitch , thinking of Masha Tchibisova , whom he had had in his mind all along , in sympathizing with Pestsov and supporting him .
This would never have been if I weren &apos;t bad .
Stepan Arkadyevitch was fond of a joke : &quot; And maybe she will come round !
He did not sleep half the night , thinking over in detail the putting of his idea into practice .
&quot; This is my position : you can trample me in the mud , make me the laughing @-@ stock of the world , I will not abandon her , and I will never utter a word of reproach to you , &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch went on .
That never happened .
&quot; Your honors have been diverting yourselves with the chase ?
&quot; So you sent word to the princess that we weren &apos;t going ! &quot; he whispered to her angrily , losing his voice .
You can &apos;t conceive how I &apos;m resting my hopes on you . &quot; &quot; Have you known Vronsky long ? &quot; she asked .
Children , who &apos;d like to race the horses with me ? &quot; The children knew Levin very little , and could not remember when they had seen him , but they experienced in regard to him none of that strange feeling of shyness and hostility which children so often experience towards hypocritical , grown @-@ up people , and for which they are so often and miserably punished .
A group of soldiers , a quartermaster , and several subalterns came up to the balcony with Vronsky .
&quot; Well ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;d better get your hair cut , it &apos;ll weigh you down , especially at the top . &quot; Vronsky was in fact beginning , prematurely , to get a little bald .
He smiled because he foresaw the topic the conversation would turn on , and he was glad of it .
&quot; Well , you have an appetite ! &quot; he said , looking at his dark @-@ red , sunburnt face and neck bent over the plate .
&quot; I am very glad I persuaded him to receive extreme unction tomorrow , &quot; she said , sitting in her dressing jacket before her folding looking @-@ glass , combing her soft , fragrant hair with a fine comb .
&quot; Oh !
Bowing in silence , he let her pass before him .
&quot; You &apos;re soon back again , sir , &quot; said Agafea Mihalovna .
&quot; Yes , but I was very much interested by your irritable neighbor , &quot; said Levin , sighing .
Without turning round he felt the eyes fixed on him , and the smile , and he could not help turning round .
She had heard his steps and voice , and had waited at the door for Mademoiselle Linon to go .
Anna Arkadyevna had not yet come in .
&quot; This is beyond everything . &quot; Without answering her husband , Anna lifted her opera @-@ glass and gazed towards the place where Vronsky had fallen ; but it was so far off , and there was such a crowd of people about it , that she could make out nothing .
Not an idea in one &apos;s brain , as empty as a drum ! &quot; But Konstantin Levin found it dull sitting and listening to him , especially when he knew that while he was away they would be carting dung onto the fields not ploughed ready for it , and heaping it all up anyhow ; and would not screw the shares in the ploughs , but would let them come off and then say that the new ploughs were a silly invention , and there was nothing like the old Andreevna plough , and so on .
She would have revealed them to anyone sooner than to her mother .
&quot; Still , it &apos;s a pity they should get those two bears without you .
&quot; But by marriages of prudence we mean those in which both parties have sown their wild oats already .
It is wrong , but I can &apos;t help it , I can &apos;t help it . &quot; &quot; Not you it was performed that noble act of forgiveness , at which I was moved to ecstasy , and everyone else too , but He , working within your heart , &quot; said Countess Lidia Ivanovna , raising her eyes rapturously , &quot; and so you cannot be ashamed of your act . &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch knitted his brows , and crooking his hands , he cracked his fingers .
I can &apos;t run to hundred @-@ pound sauces . &quot; &quot; She &apos;s unique ! &quot; said the lady of the house .
The sun was already sinking into the trees when they went with their jingling dippers into the wooded ravine of Mashkin Upland .
I &apos;d no other way out of it .
At half @-@ past nine o &apos;clock a particularly joyful and pleasant family conversation over the tea @-@ table at the Oblonskys &quot; was broken up by an apparently simple incident .
&quot; In that case he would have done wrong , and I should not have regretted him , &quot; answered Varenka , evidently realizing that they were now talking not of her , but of Kitty .
Yegor listened attentively , and obviously quite took in Levin &apos;s idea , but by way of assent to it he enunciated , greatly to Levin &apos;s surprise , the observation that when he had lived with good masters he had always been satisfied with his masters , and now was perfectly satisfied with his employer , though he was a Frenchman .
&quot; Do you paint ? &quot; said Golenishtchev , turning round quickly to Vronsky .
Her glance , the touch of her hand , set him aflame .
The maid , who had been listening at her door for a long while , came into her room of her own accord .
I &apos;ll dress at once and come down .
&quot; Isn &apos;t it , Anna ? &quot; &quot; It is upsetting , but one can &apos;t tear oneself away , &quot; said another lady .
&quot; You will come ? &quot; Dolly called after him .
The bailiff came in , and said everything , thank God , was doing well ; but informed him that the buckwheat in the new drying machine had been a little scorched .
Your action was just what it should have been .
&quot; I mean that I &apos;m acting for my own advantage .
I know his soul , and know that we are like him .
&quot; You were driving to Ergushovo , &quot; said Levin , feeling as if he would sob with the rapture that was flooding his heart .
Come , you &apos;ll be dull alone , so go and stay at Moscow a little . &quot; &quot; There , you always ascribe base , vile motives to me , &quot; she said with tears of wounded pride and fury .
He behaved with hostile courtesy , as though he were afraid of coming closer to people he did not respect .
He had enough taste for painting to be unable to finish his picture .
And in platonic love there can be no tragedy , because in that love all is clear and pure , because .... &quot; At that instant Levin recollected his own sins and the inner conflict he had lived through .
&quot; If they knew , &quot; he thought , bending his head with a significant air as he listened to the report , &quot; what a guilty little boy their president was half an hour ago . &quot; And his eyes were laughing during the reading of the report .
He looked more robust , had let his whiskers grow , but was still the same graceful creature , whose face and figure were even more striking from their softness and nobility than their beauty .
Although he said nothing to her that he could not have said before everybody , he felt that she was becoming more and more dependent upon him , and the more he felt this , the better he liked it , and the tenderer was his feeling for her .
The old man , who had put on his short sheepskin jacket , was just as good @-@ humored , jocose , and free in his movements .
As they were walking back over the cut grass , the old man called Levin &apos;s attention to the little girls and boys who were coming from different directions , hardly visible through the long grass , and along the road towards the mowers , carrying sacks of bread dragging at their little hands and pitchers of the sour rye @-@ beer , with cloths wrapped round them .
The complication was of this nature : Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s characteristic quality as a politician , that special individual qualification that every rising functionary possesses , the qualification that with his unflagging ambition , his reserve , his honesty , and with his self @-@ confidence had made his career , was his contempt for red tape , his cutting down of correspondence , his direct contact , wherever possible , with the living fact , and his economy .
&quot; Present me to your new friends , &quot; he said to his daughter , squeezing her hand with his elbow .
No , stop a minute .
What antediluvian notions you have !
&quot; How I knew it would be so !
His own peasants put every hindrance they could in the way of this new arrangement , but it was carried out , and the first year the meadows had yielded a profit almost double .
But I don &apos;t want to talk of myself , and besides I can &apos;t explain it all , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch .
&quot; And it won &apos;t run to more than twenty @-@ five yards of fagots per acre , and he &apos;s giving me at the rate of seventy roubles the acre . &quot; Levin smiled contemptuously .
As he rarely met Anna , he could say nothing but commonplaces to her , but he said those commonplaces as to when she was returning to Petersburg , and how fond Countess Lidia Ivanovna was of her , with an expression which suggested that he longed with his whole soul to please her and show his regard for her and even more than that .
&quot; He came to me too late , or I &apos;d have fixed the price for him . &quot; Ryabinin got up , and in silence , with a smile , he looked Levin down and up .
&quot; Oh !
The prince had traveled a great deal , and considered one of the chief advantages of modern facilities of communication was the accessibility of the pleasures of all nations .
&quot; Well , shall we set off ? &quot; he asked .
Well , he &apos;s of that class .
She needed consolation .
But Stepan Arkadyevitch stopped him .
On the hillside he looked back ; he could not see them in the mist that had risen from the valley ; he could only hear rough , good @-@ humored voices , laughter , and the sound of clanking scythes .
&quot; They &apos;ll open the door . &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;ll go in from the garden . &quot; And feeling satisfied that she was alone , and wanting to take her by surprise , since he had not promised to be there today , and she would certainly not expect him to come before the races , he walked , holding his sword and stepping cautiously over the sandy path , bordered with flowers , to the terrace that looked out upon the garden .
I made his acquaintance in Tver when I was there on official business , and he came there for the levy of recruits .
&quot; Walk in , your excellency , &quot; he said to Levin ; by way of showing his respect to Stepan Arkadyevitch , being attentive to his guest as well .
They prayed , as they always do , for peace from on high and for salvation , for the Holy Synod , and for the Tsar ; they prayed , too , for the servants of God , Konstantin and Ekaterina , now plighting their troth .
No , everything is over , everything that once made my comfort , the reward of my work , and my sufferings .... Would you believe it , I was teaching Grisha just now : once this was a joy to me , now it is a torture .
That chasm was life itself , the bridge that artificial life in which Alexey Alexandrovitch had lived .
Kitty listened to the words of the prayer , trying to make out their meaning , but she could not .
Levin knew his brother and the workings of his intellect : he knew that his unbelief came not from life being easier for him without faith , but had grown up because step by step the contemporary scientific interpretation of natural phenomena crushed out the possibility of faith ; and so he knew that his present return was not a legitimate one , brought about by way of the same working of his intellect , but simply a temporary , interested return to faith in a desperate hope of recovery .
Levin tried to drink coffee and put some roll in his mouth , but his mouth was quite at a loss what to do with the roll .
&quot; Send to Sury , to Tchefirovka ; if they don &apos;t come we must look for them . &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ll send , to be sure , &quot; said Vassily Fedorovitch despondently .
&quot; However happy you may be , you must regret your freedom . &quot; &quot; And confess there is a feeling that you want to jump out of the window , like Gogol &apos;s bridegroom ? &quot; &quot; Of course there is , but it isn &apos;t confessed , &quot; said Katavasov , and he broke into loud laughter .
&quot; If our husbands didn &apos;t talk to us , we should see the facts as they are .
&quot; You &apos;ve not been to see us for a long while . &quot; &quot; I was here yesterday , but at the other entrance .
She had done all she could - she had run up to him and given herself up entirely , shy and happy .
He did not even like to look at it , and had only brought it out because he was expecting an Englishman who wanted to buy it .
And the smallest , Lily , was bewitching in her naïve astonishment at everything , and it was difficult not to smile when , after taking the sacrament , she said in English , &quot; Please , some more . &quot; On the way home the children felt that something solemn had happened , and were very sedate .
She had been ill , and as spring came on she grew worse .
He saw the uncertainty in the mare &apos;s ears and lifted the whip , but at the same time felt that his fears were groundless ; the mare knew what was wanted .
He did say : &quot; Maybe I &apos;ll go to the waters , or maybe I &apos;ll come down to you . &quot; &quot; He felt dismayed and vexed for the first minute , that his brother Nikolay &apos;s presence should come to disturb his happy mood of spring .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand it at all , &quot; said Levin , blushing , and feeling that his words were stupid , and that they could not be anything but stupid in such a position .
&quot; What sense is there in murdering a man in order to define one &apos;s relation to a guilty wife and son ?
You ought to go to some warm springs , especially now you &apos;re ready for the journey . &quot; &quot; Well , I am going away the day after tomorrow , Agafea Mihalovna ; I must finish my work . &quot; &quot; There , there , your work , you say !
Levin , too , could not help smiling .
She took off her hat , and , morally speaking , tucked up her sleeves and prepared for action .
But Natalia , too , had hardly made her appearance in the world when she married the diplomat Lvov .
&quot; Excuse me , your excellency , for venturing to trouble you .
He takes away his hands and feels the shamestruck and idiotic expression of his face .
During the service he would first listen to the prayers , trying to attach some meaning to them not discordant with his own views ; then feeling that he could not understand and must condemn them , he tried not to listen to them , but to attend to the thoughts , observations , and memories which floated through his brain with extreme vividness during this idle time of standing in church .
And death , which was here in this loved brother , groaning half asleep and from habit calling without distinction on God and the devil , was not so remote as it had hitherto seemed to him .
Kitty looked at all of them with the same absent eyes as Levin .
She gazed rather a long while at him without answering , and , in spite of the shadow in which he was standing , she saw , or fancied she saw , both the expression of his face and his eyes .
Besides , he saw that if it came to talking about technique , it was impossible to praise him for it .
Except deceit and lying nothing could come of it now ; and deceit and lying were opposed to his nature .
He &apos;s a nice child , like our host here .
They were just reaching the dammed @-@ up stream on their way to the starting point .
&quot; No , you &apos;ve not got a true impression of Levin .
&quot; Let &apos;s stay a little while , &quot; answered Levin .
He prescribed more physical exercise as far as possible , and as far as possible less mental strain , and above all no worry - in other words , just what was as much out of Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s power as abstaining from breathing .
Levin was of the opinion of Darya Alexandrovna that a girl who did not marry should find a woman &apos;s duties in a family .
To explain to Stepan Arkadyevitch the state of excitement in which he found himself , he said that he was happy like a dog being trained to jump through a hoop , who , having at last caught the idea , and done what was required of him , whines and wags its tail , and jumps up to the table and the windows in its delight .
&quot; How is your mistress ? &quot; &quot; A successful confinement yesterday . &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped short and turned white .
And , not letting his comrade enter into further details of his position , Petritsky proceeded to tell him all the interesting news .
&quot; What makes you think , &quot; said Levin , trying to get back to the question , &quot; that it &apos;s impossible to find some relation to the laborer in which the labor would become productive ? &quot; &quot; That never could be so with the Russian peasantry ; we &apos;ve no power over them , &quot; answered the landowner .
And the children feel it so : Learning French and unlearning sincerity , &quot; he thought to himself , unaware that Darya Alexandrovna had thought all that over twenty times already , and yet , even at the cost of some loss of sincerity , believed it necessary to teach her children French in that way .
&quot; Your tone of contempt for us poor townsfolk ! ...
Pray to God , &quot; he repeated hurriedly .
You are so distressed , so overwrought , that you look at many things mistakenly . &quot; Dolly grew calmer , and for two minutes both were silent .
He felt as he swung his scythe that he was at the very end of his strength , and was making up his mind to ask Tit to stop .
Levin could not help recalling every word he had said , and in imagination amending his own replies .
Peace was made .
&quot; The great change is that she brought back with her the shadow of Alexey Vronsky , &quot; said the ambassador &apos;s wife .
I should hope our friendship rises above all that sort of thing .
Anna pondered for an instant in uncertainty .
The nurse was an old servant of the family .
He painted with her as his model , admired her beauty and mediævalism , and Anna dared not confess to herself that she was afraid of becoming jealous of this nurse , and was for that reason particularly gracious and condescending both to her and her little son .
At every step he found his former dreams disappointed , and new , unexpected surprises of happiness .
But her affection for Varenka did not wane .
He was impatiently looking forward to the news that she was married , or just going to be married , hoping that such news would , like having a tooth out , completely cure him .
But by now this lodge was old and dilapidated .
&quot; O Lord ! &quot; he murmured , and sighed deeply .
What business had I to interfere with outsiders ?
&quot; No , not very , &quot; he said .
When Alexey Alexandrovitch had made up his mind that he must talk to his wife about it , it had seemed a very easy and simple matter .
&quot; How do you mean ? &quot; offended that he should seem to take her suggestion unwillingly and with vexation .
At dinner ... yesterday , I was almost getting up from the dinner @-@ table .
&quot; No ! &quot; he shrieked , in his shrill voice , which pitched a note higher than usual even , and his big hands clutching her by the arm so violently that red marks were left from the bracelet he was squeezing , he forcibly sat her down in her place .
&quot; Dolly , what can I say ? ...
Having heard all the news , Vronsky , with the assistance of his valet , got into his uniform , and went off to report himself .
&quot; Sir John !
He can &apos;t get up .
&quot; There are laws , madam , and since you &apos;ve challenged me to it , I &apos;ll tell you who &apos;s to blame for it all : you and you , you and nobody else .
In the house they were only just up , and the cook came out to go marketing .
Levin obediently helped himself to sauce , but would not let Stepan Arkadyevitch go on with his dinner .
&quot; Well , anyway , I may say that I &apos;m very glad of it . &quot; &quot; That you may do tomorrow , tomorrow and nothing more !
Petritsky lived with him in camp too .
And always the same people , always the same .
All were good , pleasant .
&quot; Right ! &quot; he pronounced all at once reassuringly , as though all were solved for him .
They get a glimpse of red lips under a short veil , and exquisite little feet . &quot; &quot; You describe it with such feeling that I fancy you must be one of the two . &quot; &quot; And after what you said , just now !
Sviazhsky questioned him about his improvements on his estate , presupposing , as he always did , that there was no possibility of doing anything not done already in Europe , and now this did not in the least annoy Levin .
In reality , those who in Vronsky &apos;s opinion had the &quot; proper &quot; view had no sort of view at all , but behaved in general as well @-@ bred persons do behave in regard to all the complex and insoluble problems with which life is encompassed on all sides ; they behaved with propriety , avoiding allusions and unpleasant questions .
And I , instead of going to seek him out , went out to dinner , and came here . &quot; Levin walked up to a lamppost , read his brother &apos;s address , which was in his pocketbook , and called a sledge .
&quot; Very charming , &quot; said the countess .
When he reached the point about the fundamental and radical law , his opponent jumped up and began to protest .
Political economy told him that the laws by which the wealth of Europe had been developed , and was developing , were universal and unvarying .
Perhaps it will pass off . &quot; &quot; But you mustn &apos;t think about it . &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t help it .
Oblonsky noticed this at once , and smiled .
&quot; Don &apos;t put yourself out ; we shall get it all done in time . &quot; Levin waved his hand angrily , went into the granary to glance at the oats , and then to the stable .
how explain , how find out her wishes ? &quot; &quot; If you will allow me to give my opinion , I think that it lies with you to point out directly the steps you consider necessary to end the position . &quot; &quot; So you consider it must be ended ? &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch interrupted him .
I must disappoint you ... but he has not missed you as your husband has .
He was going to see his wife , because he had determined to see her once a week to keep up appearances .
&quot; And the worst of all is , you see , that I can &apos;t cast him off : there are the children , I am tied .
Chapter 9 The old neglected palazzo , with its lofty carved ceilings and frescoes on the walls , with its floors of mosaic , with its heavy yellow stuff curtains on the windows , with its vases on pedestals , and its open fireplaces , its carved doors and gloomy reception rooms , hung with pictures - this palazzo did much , by its very appearance after they had moved into it , to confirm in Vronsky the agreeable illusion that he was not so much a Russian country gentleman , a retired army officer , as an enlightened amateur and patron of the arts , himself a modest artist who had renounced the world , his connections , and his ambition for the sake of the woman he loved .
There , too , she descried Stiva , and there she saw the exquisite figure and head of Anna in a black velvet gown .
But intriguing people have to invent a noxious , dangerous party .
Then he took out of his notebook three notes of Anna &apos;s , read them again , burned them , and remembering their conversation on the previous day , he sank into meditation .
But his relations with these people were confined to one clearly defined channel , and had a certain routine from which it was impossible to depart .
And I can &apos;t .... &quot; &quot; Never mind , we &apos;ll slip something under and pull you out .
But with me , it &apos;s another thing ; I see through his ideas , and I know where its weakness lies . &quot; Everyone was mute .
The applicability or non @-@ applicability of the Christian precept to his own case was too difficult a question to be discussed lightly , and this question had long ago been answered by Alexey Alexandrovitch in the negative .
&quot; Kitty !
But here it seemed to Levin that just as they were close upon the real point of the matter , they were again retreating , and he made up his mind to put a question to the professor .
Sappho Shtoltz you don &apos;t know ?
And do you know , stand @-@ shooting in the morning is unusually good - why not go ?
waltz ! &quot; shouted Korsunsky from the other side of the room , and seizing the first young lady he came across he began dancing himself .
what have I done ! &quot; he cried .
And then eight hundred acres of wheat , three hundred of potatoes , and four hundred of clover , and not one acre exhausted .
&quot; Now , Kostya , you have to decide , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch with an air of mock dismay , &quot; a weighty question .
The two footmen and Matvey , in white cravats , did their duty with the dishes and wines unobtrusively , quietly , and swiftly .
&quot; How do you mean ? &quot; &quot; Like this , &quot; she said , tugging at the folds of her woolen skirt .
If he &apos;d killed me , if he &apos;d killed him , I could have borne anything , I could have forgiven anything ; but , no , he .... How was it I didn &apos;t guess what he would do ?
Gladiator and Diana came up to it together and almost at the same instant ; simultaneously they rose above the stream and flew across to the other side ; Frou @-@ Frou darted after them , as if flying ; but at the very moment when Vronsky felt himself in the air , he suddenly saw almost under his mare &apos;s hoofs Kuzovlev , who was floundering with Diana on the further side of the stream .
I arrived , &quot; answered Levin , in his emotion not at once understanding her question .
The idea of a duel had never crossed her mind , and so she put a different interpretation on this passing expression of hardness .
Chapter 8 Towards the end of May , when everything had been more or less satisfactorily arranged , she received her husband &apos;s answer to her complaints of the disorganized state of things in the country .
In the following cases : physical defect in the married parties , desertion without communication for five years , &quot; he said , crooking a short finger covered with hair , &quot; adultery &quot; ( this word he pronounced with obvious satisfaction ) , &quot; subdivided as follows &quot; ( he continued to crook his fat fingers , though the three cases and their subdivisions could obviously not be classified together ) : &quot; physical defect of the husband or of the wife , adultery of the husband or of the wife . &quot; As by now all his fingers were used up , he uncrooked all his fingers and went on : &quot; This is the theoretical view ; but I imagine you have done me the honor to apply to me in order to learn its application in practice .
I am to blame , no words can express how much I am to blame !
Well , and what do you mean to do with me ? &quot; &quot; I suppose you had better stay here , Alexander , &quot; said his wife .
Bitter memories were more and more covered up by the incidents - paltry in his eyes , but really important - of his country life .
&quot; Kouzma , get ready the trap , &quot; and he ran downstairs .
And those who only know the non @-@ platonic love have no need to talk of tragedy .
She , pleased and happy after her conversation with her daughter , had gone to the prince to say good @-@ night as usual , and though she had no intention of telling him of Levin &apos;s offer and Kitty &apos;s refusal , still she hinted to her husband that she fancied things were practically settled with Vronsky , and that he would declare himself so soon as his mother arrived .
This he used to call his day of reckoning or _ faire la lessive _ .
&quot; And this woman , &quot; Nikolay Levin interrupted him , pointing to her , &quot; is the partner of my life , Marya Nikolaevna .
At the other end sat the prince , eating heartily , and talking loudly and merrily .
But what did pass between you ?
Alexey Alexandrovitch was busily engaged with them for a long while , drew up a program for them from which they were not to depart , and on dismissing them wrote a letter to Petersburg for the guidance of the deputation .
The _ soupe Marie @-@ Louise _ was a splendid success ; the tiny pies eaten with it melted in the mouth and were irreproachable .
Yes , but then , Darmstadt was in America .
It made him uncomfortable , and it positively annoyed him to see his brother &apos;s attitude to the country .
Stepan Arkadyevitch told his wife the cause of the delay , and the guests were whispering it with smiles to one another .
&quot; But the shirt ! &quot; cried Levin .
That &apos;s her manner .... Come , boy , the soup ! ...
&quot; Very ill , &quot; he answered .
&quot; He &apos;s always out ; I scarcely ever see him , &quot; she could not resist adding with a sarcastic smile .
what for ? &quot; thought Alexey Alexandrovitch , remembering the details of divorce proceedings in which the husband took the blame on himself , and with just the same gesture with which Vronsky had done the same , he hid his face for shame in his hands .
And , as he had done every day for the last nine years , he stretched out his hand , without getting up , towards the place where his dressing @-@ gown always hung in his bedroom .
And again she felt that everything was split in two in her soul .
&quot; I &apos;ve been to see you . &quot; &quot; A meeting for one minute , for I &apos;m going , &quot; said Betsy , smiling and putting on her glove .
But after seeing his brother , listening to his conversation with the professor , hearing afterwards the unconsciously patronizing tone in which his brother questioned him about agricultural matters ( their mother &apos;s property had not been divided , and Levin took charge of both their shares ) , Levin felt that he could not for some reason begin to talk to him of his intention of marrying .
Going into the hall he saw a handsome groom , in a braided livery and a bear fur cape , holding a white fur cloak .
&quot; Now , children , run along , run along .
You like horses - and you have them ; dogs - you have them ; shooting - you have it ; farming - you have it . &quot; &quot; Perhaps because I rejoice in what I have , and don &apos;t fret for what I haven &apos;t , &quot; said Levin , thinking of Kitty .
&quot; Oh , yes , that &apos;s the best method ! &quot; he said , munching cheese and filling the wine @-@ glass with a special sort of spirit .
Levin smiled .
And his face expressed serious hesitation .
She felt a feeling such as she had known in childhood , when she had been shut in her room as a punishment , and had heard her sisters &quot; merry laughter outside .
They write me that Kitty Shtcherbatskaya &apos;s very ill . &quot; &quot; Really ? &quot; said Vronsky , knitting his brows .
and so there &apos;s no help for it . &quot; &quot; But why can &apos;t you ?
It was in himself too , he felt that .
&quot; Take the bride &apos;s hand and lead her up , &quot; the best man said to Levin .
&quot; And still no sign of my brother . &quot; &quot; Do call him , Alexey , &quot; said the old countess .
That figure lived , and was clearly and unmistakably defined .
Or has he had his hair cut ? &quot; Precisely at twelve o &apos;clock , when Anna was still sitting at her writing @-@ table , finishing a letter to Dolly , she heard the sound of measured steps in slippers , and Alexey Alexandrovitch , freshly washed and combed , with a book under his arm , came in to her .
&quot; I &apos;ve not read it , &quot; Kritsky responded gloomily , obviously not desiring to enter into the conversation .
He began to look at his picture with all his own full artist vision , and was soon in that mood of conviction of the perfectibility , and so of the significance , of his picture - a conviction essential to the most intense fervor , excluding all other interests - in which alone he could work .
It was decided that they should go together the next day .
Anna was aware from his eyes that he liked looking at her , but he avoided conversation with her .
&quot; It won &apos;t come as we suppose .
He could not go to bed , feeling that it was absolutely needful for him first to think thoroughly over the position that had just arisen .
&quot; Anna , it &apos;s necessary for me to have a talk with you . &quot; &quot; With me ? &quot; she said , wonderingly .
&quot; It &apos;s all right , sir ; she will come round , &quot; said Matvey .
She saw in him sympathy for her , but not love .
&quot; Parfen Denisitch now , for all he was no scholar , he died a death that God grant everyone of us the like , &quot; she said , referring to a servant who had died recently .
This was not what she had been reckoning on .
Here he is ! &quot; said the midwife , trying to attract her attention to Alexey Alexandrovitch .
He turned over his stout , well @-@ cared @-@ for person on the springy sofa , as though he would sink into a long sleep again ; he vigorously embraced the pillow on the other side and buried his face in it ; but all at once he jumped up , sat up on the sofa , and opened his eyes .
But I must be going , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , getting up for the tenth time .
I hear you , but I am thinking of him .
She determined that she would get the smaller part of the trousseau all ready now , and the larger part should be made later , and she was much vexed with Levin because he was incapable of giving her a serious answer to the question whether he agreed to this arrangement or not .
I &apos;ll ring . &quot; &quot; What can I write ? &quot; she thought .
Masha promised to write to Konstantin in case of need , and to persuade Nikolay Levin to go and stay with his brother .
A boy .
Leaving the school very young as a brilliant officer , he had at once got into the circle of wealthy Petersburg army men .
What do you think of that ?
In the very doorway Vronsky almost ran up against Alexey Alexandrovitch .
Perhaps it &apos;s our strong point , really , the faculty of seeing our own shortcomings ; but we overdo it , we comfort ourselves with irony which we always have on the tip of our tongues .
&quot; All right , I &apos;ll go by the forest . &quot; And Levin rode through the slush of the farmyard to the gate and out into the open country , his good little horse , after his long inactivity , stepping out gallantly , snorting over the pools , and asking , as it were , for guidance .
She longed to turn back and send him a letter to come and see her , or to go herself to see him .
What makes men go out of their minds ; what makes men shoot themselves ? &quot; he answered himself , and opening his eyes , he saw with wonder an embroidered cushion beside him , worked by Varya , his brother &apos;s wife .
As they left the pavilion , Alexey Alexandrovitch , as always , talked to those he met , and Anna had , as always , to talk and answer ; but she was utterly beside herself , and moved hanging on her husband &apos;s arm as though in a dream .
&quot; Ah !
The doctor was extremely dissatisfied with Alexey Alexandrovitch .
You can &apos;t imagine what loathsome thoughts I have about everything . &quot; &quot; Why , whatever loathsome thoughts can you have ? &quot; asked Dolly , smiling .
Levin bowed to her , and said nothing .
What do you think , isn &apos;t it time to start , Kostya ? &quot; he added .
Tried it : worse .
After having some lunch , he lay down on the sofa immediately , and in five minutes memories of the hideous scenes he had witnessed during the last few days were confused together and joined on to a mental image of Anna and of the peasant who had played an important part in the bear hunt , and Vronsky fell asleep .
&quot; I ask one thing only : I ask for the right to hope , to suffer as I do .
Katavasov , feeling his originality was appreciated and understood , made the most of it .
They could neither of them eat , however , and for a long while they could not sleep , and did not even go to bed .
He &apos;ll keep himself in the right , while me , in my ruin , he &apos;ll drive still lower to worse ruin yet .... &quot; She recalled the words from the letter .
He could not yet make out what had happened , when the white legs of a chestnut horse flashed by close to him , and Mahotin passed at a swift gallop .
&quot; They &apos;re not here , &quot; she said , shutting the drawer ; but from that action he saw he had guessed right , and roughly pushing away her hand , he quickly snatched a portfolio in which he knew she used to put her most important papers .
They assumed an air of fully comprehending the import and force of the situation , of accepting and even approving of it , but of considering it superfluous and uncalled for to put all this into words .
&quot; I rejoice , because things cannot , cannot possibly remain as he supposes . &quot; &quot; Why can &apos;t they ? &quot; Anna said , restraining her tears , and obviously attaching no sort of consequence to what he said .
Together ! &quot; cried Levin , and he ran with Laska into the thicket to look for the snipe .
&quot; I &apos;m not the first nor the last . &quot; And to say nothing of historical instances dating from the &quot; Fair Helen &quot; of Menelaus , recently revived in the memory of all , a whole list of contemporary examples of husbands with unfaithful wives in the highest society rose before Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s imagination .
He waited .
She could not frame a thought , not a wish apart from life with this man ; but this new life was not yet , and she could not even picture it clearly to herself .
&quot; Is madame at home or not ? &quot; &quot; Madame has been out for a walk but has returned now , &quot; answered the waiter .
&quot; Yes , yes ! &quot; he said , &quot; it &apos;s very possible you &apos;re right .
This exasperated and tortured Golenishtchev , but Vronsky was incapable of deceiving and torturing himself , and even more incapable of exasperation .
&quot; I &apos;m not going , &quot; said Liza , smiling and settling herself close to Anna .
We met at Rossi &apos;s , do you remember , at that _ soirée _ when that Italian lady recited - the new Rachel ? &quot; Golenishtchev answered easily , removing his eyes without the slightest regret from the picture and turning to the artist .
When , just before entering the ballroom , the princess , her mother , tried to turn right side out of the ribbon of her sash , Kitty had drawn back a little .
And could you see if my brother is here , and send him to me ? &quot; said the lady in the doorway , and stepped back again into the compartment .
At first there was the sound of merry talk and laughing all together over the supper , then singing again and laughter .
He always felt something special moving him to the quick at the hay @-@ making .
&quot; No , Stiva , &quot; she said , &quot; I &apos;m lost , lost !
&quot; Kouzma , give me my sheepskin .
&quot; Where do I come from ? &quot; he said , in answer to a question from the ambassador &apos;s wife .
&quot; Delightful child , delightful !
&quot; Remember one thing , that I needed nothing but forgiveness , and I want nothing more .... Why doesn &apos;t _ he _ come ? &quot; she said , turning to the door towards Vronsky .
Vaska bowed to the two ladies , and glanced at them , but only for one second .
But in spite of all this Levin thought the system worked , and that by keeping accounts strictly and insisting on his own way , he would prove to them in the future the advantages of the arrangement , and then the system would go of itself .
Like an ox with head bent , submissively he awaited the blow which he felt was lifted over him .
&quot; Darya Alexandrovna , &quot; he said , &quot; that &apos;s how one chooses a new dress or some purchase or other , not love .
&quot; What do you want ? &quot; she said in a rapid , deep , unnatural voice .
&quot; I have doubted , I doubt everything , &quot; said Levin in a voice that jarred on himself , and he ceased speaking .
&quot; I am glad it has all ended so satisfactorily , and that you are back again , &quot; he went on .
&quot; You take Seryozha to hurt me , &quot; she said , looking at him from under her brows .
And there &apos;s no one I could speak of it to , except you .
&quot; Kitty , what is it ? &quot; said Countess Nordston , stepping noiselessly over the carpet towards her .
The only point of interest was that it was settled they should go abroad .
Stepping noiselessly over the thick rugs , he went up to Princess Myakaya .
12 was half open , and there came out into the streak of light thick fumes of cheap , poor tobacco , and the sound of a voice , unknown to Levin ; but he knew at once that his brother was there ; he heard his cough .
Ah !
He tried to say this .
worse than lost !
&quot; I did inform you about the machine . &quot; This question was enough to take Levin back to all the details of his work on the estate , which was on a large scale , and complicated .
This horror had in his youth set him pondering on dueling , and picturing himself in a position in which he would have to expose his life to danger .
Russia needs men ; she needs a party , or else everything goes and will go to the dogs . &quot; &quot; How do you mean ?
She had an aim in life .
He cherished a grudge against Madame Stahl for not making his acquaintance .
Well , to be sure , please God , the hay &apos;s good .
There have been slaves first everywhere , then metayers ; and we have the half @-@ crop system , rent , and day laborers .
Involuntarily he talked to her in his habitual tone of jeering at anyone who should say what he was saying .
But when she arrived , he did not meet her .
Above all , it seemed strange and not right to Anna .
Anna looked out of the window and saw Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s courier on the steps , ringing at the front door bell .
&quot; Yes , my solitude is over .
Ivan Parmenov was standing on the cart , taking , laying in place , and stamping down the huge bundles of hay , which his pretty young wife deftly handed up to him , at first in armfuls , and then on the pitchfork .
&quot; There , that &apos;s enough , that &apos;s enough !
Anna found it difficult now to recall the feeling of almost awe @-@ stricken reverence which she had at first entertained for these persons .
No one ever spoke to her so but the justices of the peace who tried her for trying to get out of a house of ill @-@ fame .
Sergey Ivanovitch was a Moscow man , and a philosopher ; Alexey Alexandrovitch a Petersburger , and a practical politician .
I beg your pardon , &quot; he added , and he turned to the adjutant : &quot; Please have this divided from me , each man as much as it runs to . &quot; And he hurriedly took notes for three hundred roubles from his pocketbook , blushing a little .
I pray to God only not to take from me the bliss of forgiveness ! &quot; Tears stood in his eyes , and the luminous , serene look in them impressed Vronsky .
And that &apos;s what I wanted to see you for .
The immense stretch of meadow had been mown and was sparkling with a peculiar fresh brilliance , with its lines of already sweet @-@ smelling grass in the slanting rays of the evening sun .
&quot; You &apos;ve been quick about it ! &quot; said Oblonsky with a smile .
Tears of shame and despair choked her utterance .
She got up to rouse herself , and slipped off her plaid and the cape of her warm dress .
I foresaw nothing , and now I understand nothing . &quot; &quot; Dear friend , &quot; repeated Lidia Ivanovna .
She loves me !
Afterwards , on a day fixed beforehand , the expected offer was made to her parents , and accepted .
The snipe had ceased flying ; but Levin resolved to stay a little longer , till Venus , which he saw below a branch of birch , should be above it , and the stars of the Great Bear should be perfectly plain .
&quot; You &apos;re back from leave , I suppose ? &quot; he said , and without waiting for a reply , he turned to his wife in his jesting tone : &quot; Well , were a great many tears shed at Moscow at parting ? &quot; By addressing his wife like this he gave Vronsky to understand that he wished to be left alone , and , turning slightly towards him , he touched his hat ; but Vronsky turned to Anna Arkadyevna .
&quot; Yes ; but in that case , if you will allow me to say what I think ....
Ivan jumped down and took the quiet , sleek horse by the bridle .
&quot; Just now I &apos;m reading Duc de Lille , _ Poésie des Enfers , _ &quot; he answered .
He was attired as though for a wedding , from his cravat to his double watch @-@ chain and varnished boots .
&quot; Well , tell me all about it . &quot; And Stepan Arkadyevitch began to tell his story .
What are you coming for ? &quot; she said , letting fall the hand with which she had grasped the door post .
&quot; How those figures in the background stand out !
These were Sergey Ivanovitch , Katavasov , a university friend , now professor of natural science , whom Levin had met in the street and insisted on taking home with him , and Tchirikov , his best man , a Moscow conciliation @-@ board judge , Levin &apos;s companion in his bear @-@ hunts .
&quot; No , we &apos;d better go back , &quot; she added , noticing Levin coming towards them with his companion and a German doctor , to whom he was talking very noisily and angrily .
with what object ? &quot; said Varenka gently .
It &apos;s even more senseless .
At last one of the ladies , glancing at her watch , said , &quot; It really is strange , though ! &quot; and all the guests became uneasy and began loudly expressing their wonder and dissatisfaction .
&quot; Oh , where are you going , my lord ? &quot; he asked suddenly , using the title &quot; my lord , &quot; which he had scarcely ever used before .
The pain she had caused herself and her husband in uttering those words would be rewarded now by everything being made clear , she thought .
I saw Stiva when he was in love with you .
Most terrible of all had been his ludicrous , shameful position when Alexey Alexandrovitch had pulled his hands away from his humiliated face .
And so for this first and most important division he must have four thousand roubles .
And he had been indeed caught unawares , and at the first moment when she spoke to him of her position , his heart had prompted him to beg her to leave her husband .
He read the books lent him by Sviazhsky , and copying out what he had not got , he read both the economic and socialistic books on the subject , but , as he had anticipated , found nothing bearing on the scheme he had undertaken .
He saw it , and his face expressed that utter subjection , that slavish devotion , which had done so much to win her .
He ran into the room with the same feeling , with an even stronger feeling than he had had when he reached the Shtcherbatskys &quot; house to make his offer .
&quot; And how well things were going up till now !
I dare say I shall manage to keep it up .... &quot; &quot; Really !
What can a man write of justice who knows nothing of it ?
&quot; There is no deceit she would stick at .
But when it comes to business , we do it better than anyone .
Although his artistic sense was unceasingly at work collecting materials , although he felt a continually increasing excitement as the moment of criticizing his work drew nearer , he rapidly and subtly formed , from imperceptible signs , a mental image of these three persons .
There &apos;s so much that &apos;s interesting now in Germany , &quot; said Marya Yevgenyevna .
He went back himself to a double birch tree on the other side , and leaning his gun on the fork of a dead lower branch , he took off his full overcoat , fastened his belt again , and worked his arms to see if they were free .
But he said not at all what he had to say .
He wrote ten notes , and tore them all up , and sent the saddle without any reply .
Wasted and flushed , with a peculiar glitter in her eyes , left there by the agony of shame she had been put through , Kitty stood in the middle of the room .
Think for me , Anna , help me .
Alexander Vronsky smiled gaily .
Besides , they &apos;re received everywhere , and _ I _ &quot; - she laid special stress on the I - &quot; have never been strict and intolerant .
I have thought over everything , and I see nothing . &quot; Anna could think of nothing , but her heart responded instantly to each word , to each change of expression of her sister @-@ in @-@ law .
Why did she fix on this place to meet me , and why does she write in Betsy &apos;s letter ? &quot; he thought , wondering now for the first time at it .
&quot; Brainless beef !
Vronsky in amazement raised his head , and stared , as he knew how to stare , not into the Englishman &apos;s eyes , but at his forehead , astounded at the impertinence of his question .
If he could have heard what her parents were saying that evening , if he could have put himself at the point of view of the family and have heard that Kitty would be unhappy if he did not marry her , he would have been greatly astonished , and would not have believed it .
what was I thinking about ?
&quot; Well , did you like it ? &quot; Sergey Ivanovitch asked him .
Vronsky and he had gone completely different ways on leaving the corps , and had only met once since .
In spite of all he had seen , Alexey Alexandrovitch still did not allow himself to consider his wife &apos;s real condition .
In spite of Stepan Arkadyevitch &apos;s efforts to be an attentive father and husband , he never could keep in his mind that he had a wife and children .
Meanwhile spring came on , beautiful and kindly , without the delays and treacheries of spring , - one of those rare springs in which plants , beasts , and man rejoice alike .
The men stood round the strong @-@ smelling spirits and salt delicacies , and the discussion of the Russification of Poland between Koznishev , Karenin , and Pestsov died down in anticipation of dinner .
But , Dolly , darling , I fully realize your sufferings , only there is one thing I don &apos;t know ; I don &apos;t know ...
He staggered as he said this , and then repeated the motion , trying to make it seem as if it had been intentional .
What a spring we &apos;re having !
&quot; Keep your hands still , Grisha , &quot; she said , and she took up her work , a coverlet she had long been making .
&quot; As you like . &quot; They were standing now about fifteen paces from one another .
But the nearer the time of departure came , the bitterer was the sacrifice he was making to what he thought his duty .
She was aware of her husband approaching a long way off , and she could not help following him in the surging crowd in the midst of which he was moving .
Betsy made haste to introduce her to Anna .
And no one understands it except me , and no one ever will ; and I can &apos;t explain it .
I do it not from myself .... &quot; &quot; I cannot help thanking you . &quot; &quot; But , dear friend , do not give way to the feeling of which you spoke - being ashamed of what is the Christian &apos;s highest glory : _ he who humbles himself shall be exalted _ .
At the very instant he was going away I would have turned him back and told him , but I changed my mind , because it was strange that I had not told him the first minute .
Why do you keep fidgeting , why don &apos;t you go to sleep ? &quot; his brother &apos;s voice called to him .
Those six weeks had for her been a time of the utmost bliss and the utmost misery .
Seeing that he was powerless to begin the conversation , she began herself .
He watched how Mishka strode along , swinging the huge clods of earth that clung to each foot ; and getting off his horse , he took the sieve from Vassily and started sowing himself .
On beginning to talk to the peasants about it , and making a proposition to cede them the land on new terms , he came into collision with the same great difficulty that they were so much absorbed by the current work of the day , that they had not time to consider the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed scheme .
It &apos;s not my feeling , but a sort of force outside me has taken possession of me .
And that can only rest on a basis of freedom on both sides . &quot; &quot; Divorce , &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch interrupted , in a tone of aversion .
He had never clearly thought out the subject , but he had vaguely conceived that his wife must long ago have suspected him of being unfaithful to her , and shut her eyes to the fact .
Here , for no kind of reason , you &apos;ve made that rascal a present of thirty thousand roubles . &quot; &quot; Well , what should I have done ?
awful ! &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch kept repeating to himself , and he could think of nothing to be done .
If ... better say so , &quot; he said , not looking at her .
Crowds of well @-@ dressed people , with hats bright in the sun , swarmed about the entrance and along the well @-@ swept little paths between the little houses adorned with carving in the Russian style .
&quot; It &apos;s beyond everything what &apos;s being done in the district , according to what this doctor tells me .
I do not regret , and shall never regret , what I have done ; but I have desired one thing - your good , the good of your soul - and now I see I have not attained that .
&quot; How marvelous Christ &apos;s expression is ! &quot; said Anna .
So it seemed , at least , to the princess .
And these two influences were not in fact without effect ; though the result remained , as Vronsky had described , uncertain .
To speak of it would be to attach importance to what has no importance . &quot; She remembered how she had told her husband of what was almost a declaration made her at Petersburg by a young man , one of her husband &apos;s subordinates , and how Alexey Alexandrovitch had answered that every woman living in the world was exposed to such incidents , but that he had the fullest confidence in her tact , and could never lower her and himself by jealousy .
But this joyous smile at once recalled everything to him , and he grew thoughtful .
To be such a slave ! &quot; cried Levin , getting up , and unable to restrain his anger any longer .
A young man , and a very nice one , has fallen in love with her , and she , I fancy .... &quot; &quot; Oh , yes , you fancy !
But you &apos;re so positive you know all the lore of the forest .
He fancied that he understood what she was utterly unable to understand : how it was that , having made her husband wretched , having abandoned him and her son and lost her good name , she yet felt full of spirits , gaiety , and happiness .
There was no need whatever for me ....
He saw she had been crying .
&quot; Shall I fetch you another cup ? &quot; said she , and taking his cup she went out .
You married him without love and not knowing what love was .
&quot; But we must really be getting along if you want to be in time at the theater . &quot; Levin got up and escorted Kitty to the door .
She answered him , and all at once got up , furious .
As a bachelor , when he had watched other people &apos;s married life , seen the petty cares , the squabbles , the jealousy , he had only smiled contemptuously in his heart .
Alexey Alexandrovitch had previously felt no liking for Count Anitchkin , and had always differed from him in his opinions .
But he &apos;s dead , dead , dead ! ... &quot; &quot; How absurd you are ! &quot; said Darya Alexandrovna , looking with mournful tenderness at Levin &apos;s excitement .
&quot; He &apos;s a clever fellow , and said a lot that was true . &quot; &quot; Oh , get along with you !
&quot; Oh , where shall we meet ?
I can &apos;t see her ! &quot; she cried .
&quot; You know , Kitty &apos;s coming here , and is going to spend the summer with me . &quot; &quot; Really , &quot; he said , flushing , and at once , to change the conversation , he said : &quot; Then I &apos;ll send you two cows , shall I ?
Kitty took his hand in both hers and pressed it .
I said : &quot; Let &apos;s have music , the funeral march ! &quot; He fairly dropped asleep on the roof over the funeral march . &quot; &quot; Drink it up ; you positively must drink the brandy , and then seltzer water and a lot of lemon , &quot; said Yashvin , standing over Petritsky like a mother making a child take medicine , &quot; and then a little champagne - just a small bottle . &quot; &quot; Come , there &apos;s some sense in that .
&quot; But what &apos;s to be done ?
But now coming to the country as the head of a family , she perceived that it was all utterly unlike what she had fancied .
The family cannot be broken up by a whim , a caprice , or even by the sin of one of the partners in the marriage , and our life must go on as it has done in the past .
Could he be of any service to her ?
No , I have nothing to trouble me , &quot; she responded coldly ; and she added immediately : &quot; You haven &apos;t seen Mlle.
&quot; Come , take off your coat and stay a little , &quot; said Levin , taking his hat .
Can it be that between me and this officer boy there exist , or can exist , any other relations than such as are common with every acquaintance ? &quot; She laughed contemptuously and took up her book again ; but now she was definitely unable to follow what she read .
&quot; She &apos;s exceptionally good as an actress ; one can see she &apos;s studied Kaulbach , &quot; said a diplomatic attaché in the group round the ambassador &apos;s wife .
Why , for over a year he was innocent as a babe himself , and bashful too , &quot; answered the old man .
That &apos;s not right , &quot; he said , and he stopped , putting his head on one side and looking at Levin with his kindly , gentle eyes .
&quot; It &apos;s always of you he has talked , and , besides , he has no more money left . &quot; &quot; Read this ; Dolly writes about you , &quot; Kitty was beginning , with a smile ; but she stopped suddenly , noticing the changed expression on her husband &apos;s face .
I want to organize .... &quot; he answered hotly .
&quot; You asked when ?
Two or three people , your husband among them , understand all the importance of the thing , but the others simply drag it down .
He knows that , and knows that I am incapable of doing that . &quot; She recalled another sentence in the letter .
The horse , stiffening out its legs , with an effort stopped its rapid course , and the officer of the horse @-@ guards looked round him like a man waking up from a heavy sleep , and just managed to smile .
She was worse .
I deny it .
The mere idea of his wife , his Kitty , being in the same room with a common wench , set him shuddering with horror and loathing .
Of all she saw she liked that expression most of all , and she felt that it was the center of the picture , and so praise of it would be pleasant to the artist .
&quot; It was bound to be so , &quot; he said , not looking at her .
It &apos;s as fragrant as tea ! &quot; he repeated , wishing to change the subject .
I couldn &apos;t sleep the night anyway , but I might go straight from shooting to the station . &quot; &quot; Capital . &quot; Chapter 18 Although all Vronsky &apos;s inner life was absorbed in his passion , his external life unalterably and inevitably followed along the old accustomed lines of his social and regimental ties and interests .
Never did he work with such fervor and success as when things went ill with him , and especially when he quarreled with his wife .
Then turbot with thick sauce , then ... roast beef ; and mind it &apos;s good .
&quot; Only fancy , we all but ran over two soldiers , &quot; she began telling them at once , using her eyes , smiling and twitching away her tail , which she flung back at one stroke all on one side .
He saw that it was not all sitting still , floating smoothly ; that one had to think too , not for an instant to forget where one was floating ; and that there was water under one , and that one must row ; and that his unaccustomed hands would be sore ; and that it was only to look at it that was easy ; but that doing it , though very delightful , was very difficult .
But still he could not help struggling against it .
There was a time when I spoke of your inward attitude , but I am not speaking of that now .
Chapter 13 Levin put on his big boots , and , for the first time , a cloth jacket , instead of his fur cloak , and went out to look after his farm , stepping over streams of water that flashed in the sunshine and dazzled his eyes , and treading one minute on ice and the next into sticky mud .
&quot; Yes , he sees it all , he understands it all , and in these words he &apos;s telling me that though I &apos;m ashamed , I must get over my shame . &quot; She could not pluck up spirit to make any answer .
A smile of pleasure lighted up his face .
&quot; Ploughing up the potatoes .
He looked at her sternly when she came in , and smiled contemptuously when she said she had been unwell .
And the bushes about the river had been cut down , and the river itself , not visible before , now gleaming like steel in its bends , and the moving , ascending , peasants , and the sharp wall of grass of the unmown part of the meadow , and the hawks hovering over the stripped meadow - all was perfectly new .
&quot; Come , enough about it ! &quot; he said .
When the doctor came in she flushed crimson , and her eyes filled with tears .
Here it is ! &quot; - and Petritsky pulled a letter out from under the mattress , where he had hidden it .
She was sitting on a chest and making some arrangements with her maid , sorting over heaps of dresses of different colors , spread on the backs of chairs and on the floor .
She was an honorable woman who had bestowed her love upon him , and he loved her , and therefore she was in his eyes a woman who had a right to the same , or even more , respect than a lawful wife .
He had said what her soul longed to hear , though she feared it with her reason .
Everyone might know , might suspect it , but no one might dare to speak of it .
You can &apos;t love me ....
Vronsky had slighted her , and she had slighted him , Levin .
Answer it , and don &apos;t worry about anything just before the race .
&quot; No , do tell me why it is one can &apos;t go to sleep , and one can &apos;t help being bored ? &quot; &quot; To sleep well one ought to work , and to enjoy oneself one ought to work too . &quot; &quot; What am I to work for when my work is no use to anybody ?
The news of the death of Parfen Denisitch made a painful impression on him .
The overstrained condition which had tormented her before did not only come back , but was intensified , and reached such a pitch that she was afraid every minute that something would snap within her from the excessive tension .
At first Levin had thought of giving up the whole farming of the land just as it was to the peasants , the laborers , and the bailiff on new conditions of partnership ; but he was very soon convinced that this was impossible , and determined to divide it up .
&quot; I will communicate my decision to you by letter , &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch , getting up , and he clutched at the table .
And it &apos;s all so unimportant . &quot; &quot; Why , what is important ? &quot; said Kitty , looking into her face with inquisitive wonder .
She felt herself clad in an impenetrable armor of falsehood .
That look said : &quot; That &apos;s all very well , but as God wills . &quot; Nothing mortified Levin so much as that tone .
Anita ! &quot; he said loudly , and the swollen veins stood out like cords on his thin white neck .
Levin still kept between the young peasant and the old man .
Altogether Mihailov , with his reserved and disagreeable , as it were , hostile attitude , was quite disliked by them as they got to know him better ; and they were glad when the sittings were over , and they were left with a magnificent portrait in their possession , and he gave up coming .
The business of reorganizing the farming of his land absorbed him as completely as though there would never be anything else in his life .
The benediction and announcement can take place now .
Vronsky drew the number seven .
&quot; Yes , &quot; said he .
How I did work at it !
A smart guard jumped out , giving a whistle , and after him one by one the impatient passengers began to get down : an officer of the guards , holding himself erect , and looking severely about him ; a nimble little merchant with a satchel , smiling gaily ; a peasant with a sack over his shoulder .
It was one of those things which one knows but which one can never speak of even to oneself , so terrible and shameful would it be to be mistaken .
What am I to do ?
He waked up in the dark , trembling with horror , and made haste to light a candle .
What sort of time did she have ?
&quot; All right , sir , &quot; the Englishman &apos;s voice responded somewhere in the inside of his throat .
From his brother &apos;s Levin went to Oblonsky &apos;s office , and on getting news of the Shtcherbatskys from him , he drove to the place where he had been told he might find Kitty .
Stepan Arkadyevitch stood in a comically solemn pose beside his wife , took the holy picture , and telling Levin to bow down to the ground , he blessed him with his kindly , ironical smile , and kissed him three times ; Darya Alexandrovna did the same , and immediately was in a hurry to get off , and again plunged into the intricate question of the destinations of the various carriages .
There had been nothing definite , but Stepan Arkadyevitch was hardly ever at home ; money , too , was hardly ever forthcoming , and Dolly was continually tortured by suspicions of infidelity , which she tried to dismiss , dreading the agonies of jealousy she had been through already .
Here he is , &quot; she said to herself , seeing his powerful , shy figure , with his shining eyes fixed on her .
&quot; It &apos;s tea , not hay !
She was walking rapidly towards them carrying an elegant red bag .
The prince took off his hat and moved away with his daughter .
I don &apos;t see how we can keep on like this .
Been here long ?
I &apos;ll be bad ; but anyway not a liar , a cheat . &quot; &quot; But who is a cheat ? &quot; said Varenka reproachfully .
&quot; I am very glad , she seems a nice gi .... &quot; Sergey Ivanovitch was beginning .
Nothing but sham ! &quot; she said , opening and shutting the parasol .
He was silent for a little , drew out a hook , threw it in again , and turned to his brother smiling .
Levin wanted to , and could not , take part in the general conversation ; saying to himself every instant , &quot; Now go , &quot; he still did not go , as though waiting for something .
That will be awful for me , and for her too . &quot; &quot; Oh , well , anyway there &apos;s nothing awful in it for a girl .
He walked along the path towards the skating @-@ ground , and kept saying to himself - &quot; You mustn &apos;t be excited , you must be calm .
But as soon as he moved , the door of his room opened and Kitty peeped out .
Every eye , every opera @-@ glass , was turned on the brightly colored group of riders at the moment they were in line to start .
But with her father &apos;s coming all the world in which she had been living was transformed for Kitty .
&quot; Perhaps .
Well , what sort of bringing @-@ up can you give your babes if you do not overcome the temptation of the devil , enticing you to infidelity ? &quot; he said , with gentle reproachfulness .
What is there to enjoy in that ?
You worry about him too . &quot; &quot; Oh , he doesn &apos;t even know , &quot; she said , and suddenly a hot flush came over her face ; her cheeks , her brow , her neck crimsoned , and tears of shame came into her eyes .
&quot; Why , with you I should have got well long ago .
At the Bobrishtchevs &quot; one always enjoys oneself , and at the Nikitins &quot; too , while at the Mezhkovs &quot; it &apos;s always dull .
&quot; Dolly , &quot; she said , &quot; he has told me . &quot; Dolly looked coldly at Anna ; she was waiting now for phrases of conventional sympathy , but Anna said nothing of the sort .
Kitty looked with pride at her friend .
I mean today ...
One habitual feeling impelled him to get rid of the blame and to pass it on to her .
It was agonizing , but he considered he ought to tell her both these facts .
But more and more often , and with greater persistence , he watched her .
&quot; You know that I have come to be where you are , &quot; he said ; &quot; I can &apos;t help it . &quot; At that moment the wind , as it were , surmounting all obstacles , sent the snow flying from the carriage roofs , and clanked some sheet of iron it had torn off , while the hoarse whistle of the engine roared in front , plaintively and gloomily .
&quot; And I &apos;m not the only one , &quot; pursued Levin .
Don &apos;t talk about it .
The connection between all the forces of nature is felt instinctively .... It &apos;s particulary nice if Pava &apos;s daughter should be a red @-@ spotted cow , and all the herd will take after her , and the other three , too !
And in token of all now being well and satisfactory , she opened her mouth a little , smacked her lips , and settling her sticky lips more comfortably about her old teeth , she sank into blissful repose .
And with what result ?
The peasant &apos;s dying of hunger , but just go and take him on as a laborer , he &apos;ll do his best to do you a mischief , and then bring you up before the justice of the peace . &quot; &quot; But then you make complaints to the justice too , &quot; said Sviazhsky .
I agree with you , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , sincerely and genially ; though he was aware that in the class of those who could be bought for twopence halfpenny Levin was reckoning him too .
&quot; What don &apos;t you understand ? &quot; said Oblonsky , smiling as brightly as ever , and picking up a cigarette .
&quot; What a pity ! &quot; thought Vronsky , putting up the roof of the carriage .
&quot; I should not be able to speak to her without a feeling of reproach ; I could not look at her without resentment ; and she will only hate me all the more , as she &apos;s bound to .
Though she could not recall her own words or his , she realized instinctively that the momentary conversation had brought them fearfully closer ; and she was panic @-@ stricken and blissful at it .
Darya Alexandrovna had to drive home again to fetch her curled and pomaded son , who was to carry the holy pictures after the bride .
The handsome nurse , from whom Vronsky was painting a head for his picture , was the one hidden grief in Anna &apos;s life .
&quot; No , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , who felt a great inclination to tell Vronsky of Levin &apos;s intentions in regard to Kitty .
The sight of his younger brother &apos;s appearance had immediately put him in a good humor .
It is true that in the cattle @-@ yard things went no better than before , and Ivan strenuously opposed warm housing for the cows and butter made of fresh cream , affirming that cows require less food if kept cold , and that butter is more profitable made from sour cream , and he asked for wages just as under the old system , and took not the slightest interest in the fact that the money he received was not wages but an advance out of his future share in the profits .
How can he put up with such a position ?
As always happened with him during his solitude , a mass of ideas and feelings had been accumulating within him , which he could not communicate to those about him .
&quot; Of course I don &apos;t envy Serpuhovskoy and never could envy him ; but his advancement shows me that one has only to watch one &apos;s opportunity , and the career of a man like me may be very rapidly made .
Kitty knew that the words she had uttered in anger about her husband &apos;s infidelity and her humiliating position had cut her poor sister to the heart , but that she had forgiven her .
While still weeping over the injustice of his punishment , he was eating the tart , and kept saying through his sobs , &quot; Eat yourself ; let &apos;s eat it together ... together . &quot; Tanya had at first been under the influence of her pity for Grisha , then of a sense of her noble action , and tears were standing in her eyes too ; but she did not refuse , and ate her share .
&quot; He &apos;s killing her , &quot; said Betsy in a whisper full of meaning .
The bones of her legs below the knees looked no thicker than a finger from in front , but were extraordinarily thick seen from the side .
It was clearly and precisely defined in the code of principles by which he was guided .
She ran on , then back , read it all through , and once more read the letter all through again from the beginning .
Alexey Alexandrovitch asserted and believed that he had never in any previous year had so much official business as that year .
&quot; I &apos;m much better already , &quot; he said .
Chapter 16 All the rooms of the summer villa were full of porters , gardeners , and footmen going to and fro carrying out things .
&quot; I didn &apos;t think so ?
His pretty , boyish face , with a twist of fresh grass bound round his hair , was all working with effort ; but whenever anyone looked at him he smiled .
&quot; That &apos;s why I &apos;m telling you , just because I could never let myself doubt myself for an instant , &quot; said Anna .
&quot; That &apos;s something I miss in the country - music . &quot; &quot; No ; we only came to fetch you and thank you , &quot; she said , rewarding him with a smile that was like a gift , &quot; for coming .
Because - excuse me - of your stupid sale .... &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch frowned good @-@ humoredly , like one who feels himself teased and attacked for no fault of his own .
&quot; I used to have a very poor opinion of him too , but he , he &apos;s an awfully nice and wonderfully good @-@ hearted man .
&quot; Was ever a man in such a fearful fool &apos;s position ? &quot; he said .
And she felt so sorry for him that tears came into her eyes .
And she could not but respond with a smile - not to his words , but to the love in his eyes .
His father said he wouldn &apos;t give him any and pay his debts .
As she said good @-@ bye , Kitty begged her to come to them in Russia .
Why was it I wanted to tell him and did not tell him ? &quot; And in answer to this question a burning blush of shame spread over her face .
The gentleman was complaining of the peasants .
I &apos;m terrible , but my nurse used to tell me ; the holy martyr - what was her name ?
And believe me , it &apos;s of so little consequence .... We &apos;ve all been through it . &quot; Kitty did not speak , and her face had a stern expression .
But .... &quot; He paused , pondering whether to disclose or not to disclose his feeling to him .
Petritsky , in his overcoat , and the cavalry captain Kamerovsky , in full uniform , probably just come from duty , were sitting each side of her .
Something important ? &quot; &quot; Wasn &apos;t I dreadfully untidy ? &quot; she wondered , but seeing the smile of ecstasy these reminiscences called up , she felt that the impression she had made had been very good .
He knew she had been expecting him , had listened for him , and was now going back to the drawing @-@ room .
On the table stood medicine bottles and decanters tidily arranged , and the linen needed was folded up there , and Kitty &apos;s _ broderie anglaise _ .
But he was still alive , and from time to time he sighed .
Alexey Alexandrovitch !
He felt that this was rousing in his soul a feeling of anger destructive of his peace of mind and of all the good of his achievement .
The idea of reading the Gospel to criminals , as Aline did , particularly fascinated Kitty .
&quot; Can &apos;t he spare time to see me ? &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch .
And how if she really is in love , and he &apos;s no more thinking of marriage than I am ! ...
I &apos;m ordered exercise by the doctors too .
As he corrected the leg he looked continually at the figure of John in the background , which his visitors had not even noticed , but which he knew was beyond perfection .
Well , tell me , how have you been ?
&quot; Thank God !
That &apos;s your strong point and your failing .
Pray to God that He may in His mercy aid you and have mercy on you ! &quot; he concluded .
&quot; You &apos;re like a hen with your chickens , Darya Alexandrovna . &quot; &quot; Ah , how glad I am to see you ! &quot; she said , holding out her hand to him .
&quot; Yes , &quot; he assented ; &quot; and Princess Tverskaya &apos;s interference in the most difficult private affairs is utterly uncalled for .
He stopped at the door , and , taking off his cap , let her pass .
Now , too , he shook it off and continued the thread of his thoughts .
He kissed his brother once more , but he could not speak , and knew not what to say .
I can &apos;t forgive myself that you &apos;re unhappy ! &quot; &quot; I unhappy ? &quot; she said , coming closer to him , and looking at him with an ecstatic smile of love .
But you remember what I &apos;ve said to you .
&quot; Oh , mercy on us !
&quot; Don &apos;t let it run so long ; it &apos;s not my fault .
He knew that a great deal of attention and care was necessary in taking off the coverings , to avoid injuring the creation itself , and to take off all the coverings ; but there was no art of painting - no technique of any sort - about it .
He saw that Russia has splendid land , splendid laborers , and that in certain cases , as at the peasant &apos;s on the way to Sviazhsky &apos;s , the produce raised by the laborers and the land is great - in the majority of cases when capital is applied in the European way the produce is small , and that this simply arises from the fact that the laborers want to work and work well only in their own peculiar way , and that this antagonism is not incidental but invariable , and has its roots in the national spirit .
But he did not really need these documents .
There - incredibly naked - was the beauty Lidi , Korsunsky &apos;s wife ; there was the lady of the house ; there shone the bald head of Krivin , always to be found where the best people were .
&quot; Now , go and skate , go and skate .
He did this now .
&quot; You &apos;re always just as if you &apos;d come out of a bath after it , &quot; said Petritsky .
The herdsman ran gaily to get ready for the meadow .
&quot; You can put them on , while they have dinner . &quot; The good @-@ looking young woman came into the outer room with the full pails dragging at her shoulders .
She recognized him , and her face lighted up with wondering delight .
Twenty years before , when Dolly was a child , the lodge had been roomy and comfortable , though , like all lodges , it stood sideways to the entrance avenue , and faced the south .
And at this recollection , Stepan Arkadyevitch , as is so often the case , was not so much annoyed at the fact itself as at the way in which he had met his wife &apos;s words .
Levin felt that he meant to do something with his hand and was pulling it somewhere .
Levin by now was exhausted from mental strain .
He called him vigorously and urgently , and insisted on his stopping .
All that was left was a woman with short legs , who lay down because she had a bad figure , and worried patient Varenka for not arranging her rug to her liking .
&quot; All the same he &apos;s a good man ; truthful , good @-@ hearted , and remarkable in his own line , &quot; Anna said to herself going back to her room , as though she were defending him to someone who had attacked him and said that one could not love him .
And the day and the strength were consecrated to labor , and that labor was its own reward .
The plump officer took up the list of wines and turned to the young officer .
What do you advise ?
&quot; But in favor of foreign travel I would urge the change of habits , the removal from conditions calling up reminiscences .
&quot; In the stable , putting on the saddle . &quot; In the open horse @-@ box stood Frou @-@ Frou , saddled ready .
Though he had a great respect for his half @-@ brother , an author well known to all Russia , he could not endure it when people treated him not as Konstantin Levin , but as the brother of the celebrated Koznishev .
His attitude to society , too , was clear .
But how pale you are ! &quot; &quot; Yes , I &apos;m very weak , &quot; she said , smiling .
We in Russia refuse to see that we are the heirs of Byzantium , &quot; and he launched into a long and heated explanation of his views .
&quot; The carriage is ready , &quot; said Matvey ; &quot; but there &apos;s someone to see you with a petition . &quot; &quot; Been here long ? &quot; asked Stepan Arkadyevitch .
Obviously without the slightest effort he steered clear of all subjects which might lead to embarrassment .
&quot; How is it you don &apos;t know ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
He had been just as rude with the Sviazhskys , leaving them without saying good @-@ bye .
&quot; Come along , come along to him ! &quot; he said .
They take the very figure which cannot be taken for their art , and then .... &quot; &quot; And is it true that this Mihailov is in such poverty ? &quot; asked Vronsky , thinking that , as a Russian Mæcenas , it was his duty to assist the artist regardless of whether the picture were good or bad .
On the last step he stumbled , but barely touching the ice with his hand , with a violent effort recovered himself , and skated off , laughing .
With the insight of a man of the world , from one glance at this lady &apos;s appearance Vronsky classified her as belonging to the best society .
On hearing this Anna sat down hurriedly , and hid her face in her fan .
As to the banks , I don &apos;t know to whom they &apos;re any good .
Annushka and Seryozha , and only the most necessary things .
I , too , imagine that since he is going away , there is no sort of necessity for Count Vronsky to come here .
&quot; All our own set .
&quot; That I &apos;ve been in love with a man who didn &apos;t care a straw for me , and that I &apos;m dying of love for him ?
He felt , too , something swelling in his throat and twitching in his nose , and for the first time in his life he felt on the point of weeping .
&quot; That &apos;s just it , just it , &quot; Princess Myakaya turned to him .
If you &apos;d drunk four bottles yesterday as I did you &apos;d forget where you were lying .
But he would never go to see them again either .
She went over all her Moscow recollections .
You know .... &quot; He could not go on ; there was a sob in his throat .
&quot; Get along , get along ! &quot; said the old man , hurrying after him and easily overtaking him , &quot; I &apos;ll mow you down , look out ! &quot; And young and old mowed away , as though they were racing with one another .
But he had no experience of lack of confidence , because he had confidence in her , and told himself that he ought to have it .
He knew that Vronsky could not be prevented from amusing himself with painting ; he knew that he and all dilettanti had a perfect right to paint what they liked , but it was distasteful to him .
She is suffering so , it &apos;s sad to see her ; and besides , everything in the house is topsy @-@ turvy .
Vronsky and Anna sat almost opposite her .
&quot; What are you thinking ?
She looked straight into his face , as though imploring him to spare her , and gave her hand .
&quot; You heard , perhaps , about Pryatchnikov ? &quot; said Turovtsin , warmed up by the champagne he had drunk , and long waiting for an opportunity to break the silence that had weighed on him .
&quot; I am so happy ! &quot; Not letting go his hands , she went into the drawing @-@ room .
Kitty gazed at her in dismay as she went up .
And in return you will enjoy all the privileges of a faithful wife without fulfilling her duties .
&quot; I am very grateful for your confidence in me . &quot; He repeated gently in Russian the phrase he had said in Betsy &apos;s presence in French , and sat down beside her .
Insufferably insolent and challenging was the effect in Alexey Alexandrovitch &apos;s eyes of the black lace about the head , admirably touched in by the painter , the black hair and handsome white hand with one finger lifted , covered with rings .
My fingers - see how huge they are !
This doubt poisoned the charm of her new life .
&quot; To be sure !
About all her figure , and especially her head , there was a certain expression of energy , and , at the same time , of softness .
He had his chief support in this affair in the Countess Lidia Ivanovna .
&quot; But it seems it was the will of God , &quot; he added , and as he said it felt how foolish a remark it was , and with difficulty repressed a smile at his own foolishness .
What would become of his son in case of a divorce ?
&quot; Excuse me , countess , but I really know nothing about it , and can &apos;t tell you anything , &quot; he said , and looked round at the officer who came in behind the lady .
&quot; Nothing , &quot; she answered .
It might be bad , this new position , but it would be clear ; there would be no indefiniteness or falsehood about it .
Do you know I have got so fond of the Gypsies and Russian songs . &quot; His speech had begun to falter , and he passed abruptly from one subject to another .
You can &apos;t fancy how delightful he was ! &quot; &quot; Well , so you &apos;re content with your day .
He felt that the import of his speech was of such magnitude that every word of it would have weight .
&quot; Go round tomorrow morning , make an offer in due form , and God bless you .... &quot; &quot; Oh , do you still think of coming to me for some shooting ?
Levin read in the queer , familiar handwriting : &quot; I humbly beg you to leave me in peace .
And in that tone it was impossible to say what needed to be said to her .
what do you look like ! &quot; said Sergey Ivanovitch , for the first moment looking round with some dissatisfaction .
He intended , when he had done that , to drive to his brother &apos;s and to Betsy &apos;s and to pay several visits with a view to beginning to go into that society where he might meet Madame Karenina .
&quot; What a good deed you did yesterday to our poor compatriot ! &quot; said the princess .
As the boy read , he kept twisting and trying to tear off a button that was nearly off his jacket .
There was no trace of shell , and there was stretched over fully half the sky an even cover of tiny and ever tinier cloudlets .
&quot; I &apos;m setting off , &quot; he said again .
And they beheld a pretty woman in a hired sledge ; she overtakes them , looks round at them , and , so they fancy anyway , nods to them and laughs .
Marya Nikolaevna &apos;s prediction came true .
In early youth in the Corps of Pages , he had experienced the humiliation of a refusal , when he had tried , being in difficulties , to borrow money , and since then he had never once put himself in the same position again .
Not a sight of a horse or a cow .
But to be a town councilor and discuss how many dustmen are needed , and how chimneys shall be constructed in the town in which I don &apos;t live - to serve on a jury and try a peasant who &apos;s stolen a flitch of bacon , and listen for six hours at a stretch to all sorts of jabber from the counsel for the defense and the prosecution , and the president cross @-@ examining my old half @-@ witted Alioshka , &quot; Do you admit , prisoner in the dock , the fact of the removal of the bacon ? &quot; &quot; Eh ? &quot; &quot; Konstantin Levin had warmed to his subject , and began mimicking the president and the half @-@ witted Alioshka : it seemed to him that it was all to the point .
&quot; Really , I &apos;m quite well , mamma .
Oo ! ... &quot; he muttered , recalling everything that had happened .
&quot; Yes , yes ! &quot; he cried in a shrill voice .
Nothing &apos;s amiss .... All &apos;s well . &quot; Chapter 28 After the ball , early next morning , Anna Arkadyevna sent her husband a telegram that she was leaving Moscow the same day .
The gas jet threw its full light on the bloodless , sunken face under the black hat and on the white cravat , brilliant against the beaver of the coat .
Levin saw nothing and no one ; he did not take his eyes off his bride .
The thought that if he were held in check by her tone of quiet friendliness he would end by going back again without deciding anything came into his mind , and he resolved to make a struggle against it .
She really was both innocent and corrupt , but a sweet and passive woman .
But Vronsky was startled and annoyed by the nervous irascibility with which Golenishtchev talked of the subject that engrossed him .
Splendid ! &quot; Sviazhsky went up to Levin and invited him to come round to tea with him .
The horses were allowed to stray into the wheat because not a single laborer would consent to be night @-@ watchman , and in spite of orders to the contrary , the laborers insisted on taking turns for night duty , and Ivan , after working all day long , fell asleep , and was very penitent for his fault , saying , &quot; Do what you will to me , your honor . &quot; They killed three of the best calves by letting them into the clover aftermath without care as to their drinking , and nothing would make the men believe that they had been blown out by the clover , but they told him , by way of consolation , that one of his neighbors had lost a hundred and twelve head of cattle in three days .
That union can only be severed by a crime , and a crime of that nature brings its own chastisement . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand a word .
Only quite lately in regard to his relations with Anna , Vronsky had begun to feel that his code of principles did not fully cover all possible contingencies , and to foresee in the future difficulties and perplexities for which he could find no guiding clue .
But this great set has its subdivisions .
He &apos;s quite well .... &quot; Chapter 31 Vronsky had not even tried to sleep all that night .
Of course I won &apos;t avoid meeting Katerina Alexandrovna , but as far as I can , I will try to save her the annoyance of my presence . &quot; &quot; You are very , very absurd , &quot; repeated Darya Alexandrovna , looking with tenderness into his face .
&quot; He &apos;s looking for his wife , and she &apos;s in the middle of the pavilion .
Anna was not like a fashionable lady , nor the mother of a boy of eight years old .
All my management rests on getting the money ready for the autumn taxes , and the peasants come to me , &quot; Father , master , help us ! &quot; Well , the peasants are all one &apos;s neighbors ; one feels for them .
God is merciful ; pray to God , sir , pray to God . &quot; &quot; Come , that &apos;ll do , you can go , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , blushing suddenly .
But Levin saw that he simply did so from a feeling of propriety , and that his farm was in a flourishing condition .
Here was old Yermil in a very long white smock , bending forward to swing a scythe ; there was a young fellow , Vaska , who had been a coachman of Levin &apos;s , taking every row with a wide sweep .
Vronsky smiled with a look that seemed to say that he did not deny it , but he promptly changed the subject .
You wouldn &apos;t believe what a pleasure it is !
The plump officer rose submissively , and they moved towards the door .
Levin counted the carts , and was pleased that all that were wanted had been brought , and at the sight of the meadows his thoughts passed to the mowing .
&quot; Take away his hands , &quot; Anna &apos;s voice says .
Seryozha , all in white , with his back and head bent , was standing at a table under a looking @-@ glass , and with an expression of intense concentration which she knew well , and in which he resembled his father , he was doing something to the flowers he carried .
You know how irritable these sick people are . &quot; Kitty , scowling more than ever , kept silent , and Varenka went on speaking alone , trying to soften or soothe her , and seeing a storm coming - she did not know whether of tears or of words .
At least not solely for that ... I &apos;ve been made a _ Kammerherr _ ; of course , one has to say thank you .
&quot; That &apos;s what I wanted to say to her , &quot; said Alexey Alexandrovitch , turning away .
The colonel of the regiment had announced that if these scandals did not cease he would have to leave .
&quot; But there are the horses , too , they &apos;re not good for much . &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll get some more .
here he is ! &quot; he cried , bringing his big hand down heavily on his epaulet .
Never with any outside person , never on any official visit had he been so unnatural and false as he was that evening .
It was the gambler Myaskin , whom he knew , coming from the club .
How different it is at home !
The air was cold in the bright sun that filtered through the freshly washed leaves .
I ought to have .... &quot; But , before Alexey Alexandrovitch had time to finish his sentence , Stepan Arkadyevitch was behaving not at all as he had expected .
Why , there was scarcely a drop .
At last Vronsky , without waiting for the artist , walked away to another small picture .
Seeing her husband , she dropped her hands into the drawer of the bureau as though looking for something , and only looked round at him when he had come quite up to her .
&quot; What was it ? &quot; inquired the princess .
If they &apos;d told me at college that other people understood the integral calculus , and I didn &apos;t , then pride would have come in .
Now when he heard that she was here , he was suddenly conscious of such delight , and at the same time of such dread , that his breath failed him and he could not utter what he wanted to say .
&quot; But , Anna , &quot; said Vronsky , in a soft and persuasive voice , trying to soothe her , &quot; we absolutely must , anyway , tell him , and then be guided by the line he takes . &quot; &quot; What , run away ? &quot; &quot; And why not run away ?
&quot; But with what object ? &quot; &quot; To seem better to people , to myself , to God ; to deceive everyone .
&quot; But after all , &quot; he asked himself before turning into the boudoir , &quot; what has occurred ?
&quot; Won &apos;t you get in , sir , we &apos;ll make room this side ! &quot; she said to him .
Kitty and Levin would be of the party , and that this might not be obtrusively evident , there would be a girl cousin too , and young Shtcherbatsky , and _ la pièce de resistance _ among the guests - Sergey Koznishev and Alexey Alexandrovitch .
Anna Pavlovna came up .
She had seen her husband .
Doctoring her seemed to her as absurd as putting together the pieces of a broken vase .
Now , perhaps , she doesn &apos;t know on purpose , &quot; said Betsy , with a subtle smile .
Take European history .
He saw that this association was a mere anchor to save him from self @-@ contempt .
&quot; Yes , please . &quot; The parlor was a big room , with a Dutch stove , and a screen dividing it into two .
In his student days he had all but been in love with the eldest , Dolly , but she was soon married to Oblonsky .
&quot; I am very , very glad to see you , &quot; he went on .
A sketch had been made before , but he was dissatisfied with it .
And when he got out of the carriage at Bologova to get some seltzer water , and caught sight of Anna , involuntarily his first word had told her just what he thought .
What right had I to imagine she would care to join her life to mine ?
At your service , &quot; he said to his wife , sitting down .
She crimsoned , turned white , crimsoned again , and grew faint , waiting with quivering lips for him to come to her .
A hawk flew high over a forest far away with slow sweep of its wings ; another flew with exactly the same motion in the same direction and vanished .
And the mowing to be all done by hired labor , not on half @-@ profits .
Betsy reminded her that Liza Merkalova and Baroness Shtoltz were coming to play croquet with her that morning with their adorers , Kaluzhsky and old Stremov .
Two gentlemen with lighted cigarettes passed by her .
But the expression of her face , scared and gloomy , did not now promise even deception .
Since Alexey Alexandrovitch had left home with the intention of not returning to his family again , and since he had been at the lawyer &apos;s and had spoken , though only to one man , of his intention , since especially he had translated the matter from the world of real life to the world of ink and paper , he had grown more and more used to his own intention , and by now distinctly perceived the feasibility of its execution .
&quot; There &apos;s a first @-@ rate Tintoretto there .
&quot; What &apos;s that on the arm of the chair , a fur cloak or some beast ?
Even the sequence of these images and emotions was the same .
What have I to be afraid of ?
They were already making ready their handfuls of mud to fling at her when the right moment arrived .
&quot; Of course , he &apos;s not without talent , but it &apos;s all in a wrong direction .
Larks trilled unseen above the velvety green fields and the ice @-@ covered stubble @-@ land ; peewits wailed over the low lands and marshes flooded by the pools ; cranes and wild geese flew high across the sky uttering their spring calls .
It was not yet two , when the large glass doors of the boardroom suddenly opened and someone came in .
What do I want ?
That article &apos;s too deep for many people - that &apos;s to say it &apos;s over their heads .
This glow shone out in her exquisite , truly enigmatic eyes .
&quot; I shall be very glad to ; I &apos;ll go and put on my hat .
But his face was so piteous , that she restrained her vexation , and flinging some clothes off an armchair , she sat down beside him .
I want to look at her . &quot; &quot; Come along , then , &quot; said the Englishman , frowning , and speaking with his mouth shut , and , with swinging elbows , he went on in front with his disjointed gait .
&quot; Because I didn &apos;t see the use of wasting my time over it . &quot; &quot; Oh , but excuse me , how did you know it would be wasting your time ?
&quot; I fancied something of the sort yesterday .
How can you believe .... &quot; But she would not let him interrupt her .
They enjoyed drinking out of the shallow cup of warm red wine and water , and they were still more pleased when the priest , flinging back his stole and taking both their hands in his , led them round the lectern to the accompaniment of bass voices chanting &quot; Glory to God . &quot; Shtcherbatsky and Tchirikov , supporting the crowns and stumbling over the bride &apos;s train , smiling too and seeming delighted at something , were at one moment left behind , at the next treading on the bridal pair as the priest came to a halt .
There &apos;s a big she @-@ bear ; one can go right up to the lair .
But that &apos;s not the point , &quot; and he turned again to the general with whom he was talking seriously ; &quot; we mustn &apos;t forget that those who are taking part in the race are military men , who have chosen that career , and one must allow that every calling has its disagreeable side .
Why , what is it ?
He walked back , went into his room again , and asked for coffee .
Yashvin overtook him with his cap , and led him home , and half an hour later Vronsky had regained his self @-@ possession .
&quot; I have the honor of knowing your brother , Sergey Ivanovitch , &quot; said Grinevitch , holding out his slender hand with its long nails .
Levin heard the words , and they impressed him .
Come , tell me .... Stop a minute , let &apos;s sit down , &quot; said Kitty , making her sit down again beside her .
Well , then what of it ?
God is merciful ... thanks .... &quot; he said , not knowing what he was saying , as he responded to the tearful kiss of the princess that he felt on his hand .
Vronsky , Anna , and Golenishtchev , on their way home , were particularly lively and cheerful .
After the women came the men with pitchforks , and from the gray rows there were growing up broad , high , soft haycocks .
He was , as it were , stripping off the wrappings which hindered it from being distinctly seen .
Kitty wrote that no prospect was so alluring as to spend the summer with Dolly at Ergushovo , full of childish associations for both of them .
&quot; What &apos;s the matter with you ? &quot; Shtcherbatsky asked him .
On his invitation , the two elder ones at once jumped out to him and ran with him as simply as they would have done with their nurse or Miss Hoole or their mother .
&quot; Thank you , very good , &quot; she answered .
She both feared his speaking and wished for it .
&quot; Not bad , &quot; he repeated , turning his dewy , brilliant eyes from Levin to the Tatar .
It &apos;s a matter of ten roubles , &quot; he added , relaxing his lips into a smile .
Except for the slight quiver of her lips and the moisture in her eyes that made them brighter , her smile was almost calm as she said : &quot; How long it is since we &apos;ve seen each other ! &quot; and with desperate determination she pressed his hand with her cold hand .
He flew down , and without even changing the position of his hands , skated away over the ice .
He knew that would be an act of vengeance on his part , and that he did not want .
Her eyes were particularly bright , and were continually swimming with tears .
But that &apos;s just why I &apos;m afraid to speak - because I &apos;m happy now , happy in hope , anyway .... And then ? ...
But Levin &apos;s words did not , it seemed , make much impression on the priest .
One of the chief difficulties was that the process of cultivating the land was in full swing , that it was impossible to stop everything and begin it all again from the beginning , and the machine had to be mended while in motion .
Folding the letter and smoothing it with a massive ivory knife , and putting it in an envelope with the money , he rang the bell with the gratification it always afforded him to use the well arranged appointments of his writing @-@ table .
Bending her curly black head , she pressed her forehead against a cool watering pot that stood on the parapet , and both her lovely hands , with the rings he knew so well , clasped the pot .
When she had got round the turn , she gave herself a push off with one foot , and skated straight up to Shtcherbatsky .
She dared not show him her sense of her own insignificance beside him .
But this interview was still of the utmost gravity for her .
He was only looking at the book to avoid conversation with the officers coming in and out ; he was thinking .
&quot; That gentleman must be a man of great energy , &quot; said Grinevitch , when Levin had gone away .
&quot; And do you suppose she understands nothing ? &quot; said Nikolay .
But listen : we &apos;re the same age , you &apos;ve known a greater number of women perhaps than I have . &quot; Serpohovskoy &apos;s smile and gestures told Vronsky that he mustn &apos;t be afraid , that he would be tender and careful in touching the sore place .
Darya Alexandrovna Oblonskaya had invited him , when he was over there , to come ; to come with the object of renewing his offer to her sister , who would , so she gave him to understand , accept him now .
It was past one o &apos;clock .
&quot; Why ever shouldn &apos;t you manage it ? &quot; &quot; We positively must have another fifteen laborers .
That &apos;s just what Anna Arkadyevna has just said . &quot; &quot; I should be very glad if I had said it , for it &apos;s not only clever but true , &quot; said Anna , smiling .
Alexey Alexandrovitch halted in the middle of the room .
Only when he stood by her head , she was suddenly quieter , while the muscles quivered under her soft , delicate coat .
Chapter 19 &quot; Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes . &quot; So Levin thought about his wife as he talked to her that evening .
He &apos;s persecuted by the police , of course , because he &apos;s not a scoundrel . &quot; And he looked round in the way he always did at everyone in the room .
&quot; Here we live , and know nothing of what &apos;s going on , &quot; Vronsky said to Golenishtchev as he came to see him one morning .
And going back into the drawing @-@ room , they stood in a corner .
He could not even think of the problem of death itself , but with no will of his own thoughts kept coming to him of what he had to do next ; closing the dead man &apos;s eyes , dressing him , ordering the coffin .
&quot; It &apos;s too violent a transition , &quot; he said , &quot; to go from such company to old Madame Vrede .
She looked round for someone to give her fan to , and their hostess , smiling to her , took it .
&quot; I &apos;ll put them on directly , &quot; he said .
&quot; You don &apos;t know !
&quot; I &apos;m a wicked woman , a lost woman , &quot; she thought ; &quot; but I don &apos;t like lying , I can &apos;t endure falsehood , while as for _ him _ ( her husband ) it &apos;s the breath of his life - falsehood .
&quot; Come , I &apos;ll do it all , if you like .... &quot; &quot; Yes , they must be reconciled , &quot; thought Anna .
I am very unhappy . &quot; He had no need to say that .
Her face looked weary , and there was not that play of eagerness in it , peeping out in her smile and her eyes ; but for a single instant , as she glanced at him , there was a flash of something in her eyes , and although the flash died away at once , he was happy for that moment .
&quot; We have succeeded in getting the information from the government department of Penza .
She had by now got her household matters so satisfactorily arranged , thanks to Marya Philimonovna , that she was disinclined to make any change in them ; besides , she had no faith in Levin &apos;s knowledge of farming .
But her brother did not hear her .
He vaguely felt that there was something in it insulting to him , and he was not angry now at what had disturbed him , but he fell foul of everything that presented itself .
Images , memories , and ideas of the strangest description followed one another with extraordinary rapidity and vividness .
This was not as it should be , but with the laborers Levin seldom lost his temper .
Vronsky gazed , never taking his eyes from her , and smiled , he could not have said why .
&quot; But how did she go through it ?
&quot; What does it mean ?
&quot; I think you are partly right .
The hurdles , as he ascertained , being not wanted in winter , had been carried to the cart @-@ horses &quot; stable ; and there broken , as they were of light construction , only meant for feeding calves .
&quot; It was ever so nice of you to come . &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch kissed her hand .
&quot; I &apos;ve always been hearing about you through my wife , &quot; said Serpuhovskoy .
If Levin had been alone now with his brother Nikolay , he would have looked at him with terror , and with still greater terror waited , and would not have known what else to do .
Don &apos;t thank me .
taken a stray swarm , Fomitch ? &quot; he asked .
It is true that Fyodor Ryezunov &apos;s company did not plough over the ground twice before sowing , as had been agreed , justifying themselves on the plea that the time was too short .
&quot; What am I to write to him ? &quot; said Levin .
Anna was even more friendly to him than to other people , and was very grateful for her portrait .
&quot; _ Erlaucht , Durchlaucht ? _ &quot; Directly they say &quot; _ Durchlaucht _ , &quot; I can &apos;t hold out .
He particularly liked the program of that day &apos;s dinner .
Serpuhovskoy had planned his appointment at Tashkend , and Vronsky agreed to the proposition without the slightest hesitation .
Koznishev admitted both points , but with limitations .
Be that as it might , when , on the seventh day , he parted from the prince , who was starting for Moscow , and received his thanks , he was happy to be rid of his uncomfortable position and the unpleasant reflection of himself .
Chapter 7 On arriving in Moscow by a morning train , Levin had put up at the house of his elder half @-@ brother , Koznishev .
Everyone has enough to bear in his own grief ! &quot; And regaining his self @-@ possession , Alexey Alexandrovitch quietly took leave and went away .
Moreover , in the event of divorce , or even of an attempt to obtain a divorce , it was obvious that the wife broke off all relations with the husband and threw in her lot with the lover .
She knew , too , that in spite of his official duties , which swallowed up almost the whole of his time , he considered it his duty to keep up with everything of note that appeared in the intellectual world .
What &apos;s to be done - you tell me that , what &apos;s to be done ?
Well , then , there &apos;s nothing left but to pray to God .
Aliosha , it is true , did not stand quite correctly ; he kept turning round , trying to look at his little jacket from behind ; but all the same he was wonderfully sweet .
To forget ! &quot; he said to himself with the serene confidence of a healthy man that if he is tired and sleepy , he will go to sleep at once .
He disliked contradiction , and still more , arguments that were continually skipping from one thing to another , introducing new and disconnected points , so that there was no knowing to which to reply .
&quot; This morning Liza came to see me - they &apos;re not afraid to call on me , in spite of the Countess Lidia Ivanovna , &quot; she put in - &quot; and she told me about your Athenian evening .
The tone in which her husband had said the last words wounded her , especially because he evidently did not believe what she had said .
She is up , &quot; answered the girl .
oysters . &quot; Stepan Arkadyevitch became thoughtful .
&quot; No honor , no heart , no religion ; a corrupt woman .
&quot; So much the better , &quot; thought Vronsky , when he received the news .
The adjutant @-@ general expressed his disapproval of races .
And there &apos;s nothing left for me but .... &quot; She would have said death , but Stepan Arkadyevitch would not let her finish .
Her success in society had been greater than that of either of her elder sisters , and greater even than her mother had anticipated .
Stremov joined in her entreaties .
&quot; Not at all , &quot; he said .
&quot; There , how do you manage never to be bored by things ?
Oh , wait a minute , though , &quot; he said , still holding her and stroking her soft little hand .
Levin led his friend to the room set apart for visitors , where Stepan Arkadyevitch &apos;s things were carried also - a bag , a gun in a case , a satchel for cigars .
&quot; Is not a divorce possible ? &quot; he said feebly .
And this knowledge poisoned the pleasure he had hoped to find in the visit to Sviazhsky .
&quot; No , I &apos;m not dull , I am very busy , &quot; he said , feeling that she was holding him in check by her composed tone , which he would not have the force to break through , just as it had been at the beginning of the winter .
But remembering the muzzle , she shook it and again began restlessly stamping one after the other her shapely legs .
How delighted I should have been to see that crowd under the windows !
&quot; We &apos;ll admit , princess , that that &apos;s not superficial , &quot; he said , &quot; but internal .
&quot; Yes , yes , to be sure ; it does waste a lot of time , &quot; the doctor responded vaguely to some reply of Sludin &apos;s he had not caught .
&quot; I sent to Alexey to find out how he is , and he writes me he is quite well and unhurt , but in despair . &quot; &quot; So _ he _ will be here , &quot; she thought .
In the very heat of the day the mowing did not seem such hard work to him .
The gray @-@ whiskered landowner smiled at the mention of the profits of Sviazhsky &apos;s famling , obviously aware how much gain his neighbor and marshal was likely to be making .
And the bridal pair tried several times to understand what they had to do , and each time made some mistake and were corrected by the priest in a whisper .
What is to be , will be !
But in spite of this , while he was turning over his studies , pulling up the blinds and taking off the sheet , he was in intense excitement , especially as , in spite of his conviction that all distinguished and wealthy Russians were certain to be beasts and fools , he liked Vronsky , and still more Anna .
&quot; I understand it all .
Levin thought of the text , not because he considered himself &quot; wise and prudent . &quot; He did not so consider himself , but he could not help knowing that he had more intellect than his wife and Agafea Mihalovna , and he could not help knowing that when he thought of death , he thought with all the force of his intellect .
Her husband , about whom everything was well known beforehand , had come , looked at his future bride , and been looked at .
He begged pardon , and was getting into the carriage , but felt he must glance at her once more ; not that she was very beautiful , not on account of the elegance and modest grace which were apparent in her whole figure , but because in the expression of her charming face , as she passed close by him , there was something peculiarly caressing and soft .
They went into the little yard in front of the shed .
We see the Rhine provinces have been turned French , but the Germans are not at a lower stage ! &quot; he shouted .
And me to go magnanimously to forgive her , and have pity on her !
She brought her clothes and a note .
The greater number of the middle @-@ aged people and certain great personages were displeased at the prospect of the impending scandal in society .
But I must !
But one thing is possible , one thing she might desire , &quot; he went on , &quot; that is the cessation of your relations and all memories associated with them .
He shook hands with him , and together they ascended the steps .
The crowd who had left the train were running back again .
For such work us fellows would catch it ! &quot; The grass became softer , and Levin , listening without answering , followed Tit , trying to do the best he could .
I want to see him . &quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch took Vronsky &apos;s hands and drew them away from his face , which was awful with the expression of agony and shame upon it .
Eh ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s all the same to me .
If I don &apos;t know , it &apos;s my fault ; either I &apos;m stupid or a naughty boy , &quot; thought the child .
&quot; One goes for a walk , one looks in a shop , and they ask you to buy .
&quot; Why , you saved that Levin from disagreeable consequences . &quot; &quot; Yes , _ sa compagne _ called me , and I tried to pacify him , he &apos;s very ill , and was dissatisfied with the doctor .
The priest turned to Levin saying something .
pardon ! _ Waltz !
The mare &apos;s excitement had infected Vronsky .
He would have to pay some two thousand roubles on these debts too , in order to be quite free from anxiety .
Oh , Semyon the contractor came the day after you left .
He had bachelor tastes , and it was in accordance with them that he shaped his life .
&quot; Alexey Alexandrovitch , forgive me , I have no right ... but I love Anna as a sister , and esteem her ; I beg , I beseech you to tell me what is wrong between you ?
This slight , as it were , rebounded upon him .
The last class of debts - to shops , to hotels , to his tailor - were such as need not be considered .
&quot; You &apos;ve long been expected , prince . &quot; &quot; What did you send word to the princess that we weren &apos;t going for ? &quot; the artist whispered hoarsely once more , still more angrily , obviously exasperated that his voice failed him so that he could not give his words the expression he would have liked to .
But time and work did their part .
&quot; According to that , if my senses are annihilated , if my body is dead , I can have no existence of any sort ? &quot; he queried .
In the middle of the winter Vronsky spent a very tiresome week .
I &apos;ve made a mess of my life .
I don &apos;t want anything .
&quot; Varenka , forgive me , do forgive me , &quot; whispered Kitty , going up to her .
At his usual time he got up and made his toilet for the night .
You are one of those delightful women in whose company it &apos;s sweet to be silent as well as to talk .
He simply gave Alexey Alexandrovitch the money he needed together with a brief statement of the position of his affairs , which was not altogether satisfactory , as it had happened that during that year , owing to increased expenses , more had been paid out than usual , and there was a deficit .
&quot; The horses can be taken out and I will see no one , &quot; he said in answer to the porter , with a certain pleasure , indicative of his agreeable frame of mind , emphasizing the words , &quot; see no one . &quot; In his study Alexey Alexandrovitch walked up and down twice , and stopped at an immense writing @-@ table , on which six candles had already been lighted by the valet who had preceded him .
He found fault with the doctor , regretting he had not a celebrated Moscow doctor .
Stepan Arkadyevitch &apos;s eyes sparkled merrily .
&quot; Your brother left a letter and a note for you .
Where is he ?
what have I done ?
who made all that enchants me in this world - the earth , the waters , the sun , the flowers , the grass ? &quot; Can you say to him : &quot; I don &apos;t know &quot; ?
&quot; How do you feel ? &quot; she asked him .
To my thinking , in your position what &apos;s essential is the formation of a new attitude to one another .
I am going away at once , and you may live here with your mistress ! &quot; And she went out , slamming the door .
After all &apos;s said and done , we &apos;re not strangers .
Quite well ?
Levin led him into his study .
There was nothing .
He felt that his heart was throbbing , and that he , too , like the mare , longed to move , to bite ; it was both dreadful and delicious .
Kitty was silent for a few seconds , looking timidly and ruefully at her husband ; then she went up and took him by the elbow with both hands .
But what &apos;s the use of talking ?
&quot; I told them to come on Sunday , and till then not to trouble you or themselves for nothing , &quot; he said .
&quot; Oh , Agafea Mihalovna , &quot; said Stepan Arkadyevitch , kissing the tips of his plump fingers , &quot; what salt goose , what herb brandy ! ...
&quot; He has great talent , &quot; said Anna with a delighted smile .
But it appeared that the carpenter was repairing the harrows , which ought to have been repaired before Lent .
&quot; _ Entendons nous .... _ &quot; But in her eyes there were gleams of light that betrayed that she understood perfectly and precisely as he did what hope he might have .
Among the brides that came back to her memory , she thought too of her darling Anna , of whose proposed divorce she had just been hearing .
Before you &apos;ve time to get your hat on , I &apos;ll be back . &quot; And he ran downstairs , clattering with his heels like a spring @-@ rattle .
&quot; Do this for my sake , &quot; the Countess Lidia Ivanovna had said to him .
After looking round the parlor , Levin went out in the back yard .
